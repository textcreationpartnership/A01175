            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſeemeth that my calamities doe call, follow, and one enterteine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not vnlike the waues, ſurges &amp; currants of waters: the end of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein warres hath bene to me th'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ciuil warres, and cruil warres do cauſe to reflow on me, like a violent ſtreame of brimſtone, the furie of all my borderers. They ſay, that warres are to Eſtates and Common weales, that which medicines, bloudlettings, cauſtiks, and ſetons are to the body of man: By ſuch meanes the body is purged of bad and ſuperfluous humors encroching either by influence of the ſtarres, or by diſtemper of ſeaſons corrupting the ayer, or by exceſſe and abuſe in this life, committed by our Fathers or our ſelues: warres in like manner do cleanſe Eſtates of wits that are reſtleſſe &amp; vnruly, mabitious, cholerick, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, longing for inuaſions, &amp; hungring after other mens good and bloud. This they ſay, but I feele the contrary. Howbeit the caſe being ſo, I made an end of forrein warres too ſoone, it was no time to giue ouer the Phyſicion, to pay th'Apothecaries bill, to vndoe the rollers, to take of the cauſtiks and ſetons, and to cloſe vp the woundes: ſomewhat remained of th'exceſſe and conflict betweene the humors and their qualities, great ſtore of corrupt dregs and inflammation lurked yet within the bloud
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2735:4"/>and woundes, the ſwoord, torment and loſſe had not yet cleered all the paſſions of diſtempered ſpirites. Nay rather, our great God was not appeazed of his wrath, nor we reconciled to him, he had not reuoked his hardning of our hartes, neither were the phials of his furie emptied. Alas! I felt no euill but in the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt partes, in the inferior members ſubiect in vſe to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, in the feete and handes: but now the euill is got within, it hath ſeized the vitall parts, the principall members, it is ſpred ouer all. It is now no more a Rheume, a ſquincie, a particular downe flux of humors: it is euen an apoplexie, a generall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, an vniuerſall corruption. Warre with its waſt was no where but in the frontiers, in Picardy, in Burgonie, or in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne and Daulphiny: now it is in the very middeſt of mee, it is ouer all, not onely within Prouinces and Gouernements, but euen within townes &amp; cities, within boroughs, villages and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels; in houſes particular, euen in granges &amp; ſolitary dwellings; betweene the husband and wife the father and children, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters; &amp; which is yet more horrible each one of my children, at leaſt the more part, hath warre within his owne conſcience. So that for theſe 28. or 30. yeeres paſt, I haue vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally bene filled with outcries, hurlyburlies, and affray, with aſhes, bloud, and with rubbiſh of ruines; mine euill is become mine habite, and to be ill diſpoſed is my ordinary diſpoſition. Now if any diſcontinuance came betweene, it was but as of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents lightnings before a new fitte, or playing of the pulſe; it was to take cauſe, force and new footing: it ſurceaſed not but onely to take breath and rallie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſelfe, and ſo to returne with more aſſurance to the medley, to the charge, to the fight. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more the Pacifications haue appeared in effect to haue bin nothing leſſe then that they haue ſignified. For I haue ſeene more iniuſtice &amp; violence, I haue heard more plaints &amp; groanes in ſuch peace, then in the warre: to be ſhort the harder and more violent ſtrokes of the warre haue lighted on mee during thoſe Pacifications. Alas! hath any one of my townes bene exempt from the ghaſtly blowes of outrage? My ſonnes are degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they haue lien downe like ſauage beaſtes, ſnared in the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies of euery ſtreete, full of the wrath and threatning of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2735:4"/>Lord. Is there any member of mine not craſed thoroughout, or voide of woundes and filthines? My Church-men are marred and corrupt: they were wont to take tithe; now adaies they are not onely tithed themſelues, but alſo muſt forgoe both fruite and gleebe; they haue left deuotion and charitie, to embrace hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and madnes, to plot practiſes, and contriue murthers. Of my nobility remaine none almoſt but widowes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes; their ſmall reliques ſuruiuing ſeeme enclined rather to vndermine abate and turne my houſe vpſide downe, then to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, prop and defend the ſame. I ſee my Iuſtice no more, I can not diſcerne my Iuſticers by their long robe, grauitie and modeſty; all the world is furious and armed: they haue forſaken the doctrine, the true honor and feare of God, they breath of nought els ſauing worldly glorie and gaine. All my villages &amp; champion ſoyles are conuerted into ſepulchres, monuments and churchyardes: my poore Villagers doo reſemble goblins, ghoaſtes forepined of skin &amp; bone, without fleſh; ſo many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, ſo many Anatomies: they be labourers no more, they be all counſellers of Eſtate, they obſerue no longer the ſeaſons of the yeere, the motions and alterations of the ayre; and they haue reaſon: ſince that they ſow no more, the imuries of th'ayre can hurt them no more: but they are buſie to marke the motions and alterations that happen in the Eſtate and common wealth; for from this quarter comes the tempeſt on that little which is left them: they are inquiſitiue, and heare ſpeach of kings more commonly, then Gouernours of Prouinces did in ancient time. Finally, on what ſide ſoeuer I turne mine eyes, I ſee nothing but deformitie. Alas! I hoped during the laſt peace, that my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after they knew the vanitie of their conceipts and deſires, the difficultie of their enterpriſes the ſmall fruite, and that ſame euill, of their actions, of their paines and trauaile, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the curſe of God vpon them, after they had by ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of yeeres endured and felt the troubles, horror, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome toyles of warre, after they had not got one iote of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the ruine alone of their publike weale, of mee that am their mother, and yet moreouer each one his owne particular ruine and confuſion: I dare aſſure my ſelfe, ſaid I, that they will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2735:5"/>hold themſelues to this laſt peace: I ſuppoſed that lacke of bloud and ſinewes would not ſuffer them to continue their furious ſtirres, that faintnes would enforce them to remaine peaceable, would yeeld and betake them to repoſe and ſleepe. And ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped I to repoſe my ſelfe, to recouer by meanes of a peaceable ſleepe my firſt naturall beauty and diſpoſition. I hoped in ſhort time to recouer my firſt eſtate; to recall, ſettle againe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne my children each one in his true vocation; to render them the contentment they were wont to receyue of me; to reeſtabliſh and repayre for them my ruines and waſtes; to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie, weede, and trimme for them my fruites; to moderate by the ſame meane their concupiſcences, to qualifie their cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, o rule their deſires, to refine their willes, to renew, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh and confirme their amities, to vnite them together. The purgations which I miniſtred in the mean ſeaſon towards Picardie on the one ſide, and towardes Guien for Portugall on the other, ſtrengthened my hope very much: the effect it ſelfe and forwardnes of my reparations, confirmed me farre more, and kindled my naturall heate, and diligent heed, vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a full enioyment. I ſaw mine olde skin pill, fall of and vaniſh away; I perceiued mens ſpirites did cleere; I perceiued that out of their willes dreined hate, enuie, pride, ambition, and other like workers of enmitie and diſcord: charitie began to warme the hearts of my children, and to moue their bowels; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of religion was made no more a different marke for perſons, houſes, and townes; religion was no longer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of good wil and amitie, of grudge and enmitie. But, good God, behold all my hopes daſhed; the raſh zeale of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in deede mortified, but the other cauſe of my ciuil warres, to wit ambition, was not. Behold me now fallen into a relapſe worſe than the former. I know now, my children were not werie but in body, they repoſed but their bodies during the peace. For it appeareth at this day to me, that while peace la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, their trauell euer laſted by giftes and promiſes, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and gratifyings, to ſeeke them partakers, amities, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, fauours and ſuccours, not in this Realme alone, but throughout all the dominions of Europe alſo. I ſee on the one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2735:5"/>fide the more part of my children in armes and vprore, vpon ſhew of hope offered, that Fraunce ſhalbe like thoſe fortunate Iſles for the Clergie; that no Gentleman ſo ſimple, but ſhalbe glutted with honour and riches, but ſhalbe created inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Gouernor, Earle, Vicount, or Baron; that all my Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhalbe Chancelers or Counſellers of eſtate; all my Townes ſhalbe free, peaceable, priuiledged, as thoſe of the Empire, or of the Cantons. But this ſufficed not; they haue diſtruſted their owne force as vnable to ruine me; they haue thought their owne armes too faint and feeble to ſlay themſelues, to foile and pull me downe on themſelues; they muſt therefore wage ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. On this their partie, I ſpie the Pope, who vnder aſſurance of reeſtabliſhing his credite, firſt here, and thenelſwhere, drawes out both his blades, and makes a luſtie flouriſh. I ſee there the Spaniſh Tyrant, who gaping for a good ſhare, and ſpeciallie thinking to haſten the ſale of me which I perceiue hath bene made him, as alſo to auoide the ranſacking of his vſurpations, and to weaken his neighbors, vnladeth his ſhips freighted with treaſures within my hauens. I ſee there the Loraine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyen, who allot to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues alreadie the Countries lying moſt commodious for them. Yet was not that partie or ſide ſtrong inough, it ſufficed them not to paſſe the mountaines; they muſt trauerſe Italie ouer, and the ſea, or els all along the gulfe of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, to bring hither Albanians, and ſo to reenforce this partie. Aboue three yeeres are paſt ſince the auctors of this partie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in armes in the middeſt of me, hauing for their cheefe Standard for their white Cornet, the League, the conſpiracie well ſigned of all theſe partakers, of all theſe Potentates. The king (forſooth) muſt enter into this league: that is, in good phraſe and bad French, he himſelfe with all his power muſt rely on them; he muſt aduaunce them aloft, that they with more eaſe may take his crowne off his head, or at leaſt that they may firſt ſeize on it after his death, be it naturall, or procured; or els he muſt determine to runne the race of poore Childeric; he muſt take this <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> this <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> this confection of Alker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, or els he muſt ſee his owne ſpeedie death, he muſt ſee his owne limmes fall of and forſake him. His Lieutenants, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2735:6"/>and Townes awayted not (ſaid they) but his refuſall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his minde: the Pope had an infinite ſort of men in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh amid the mountaines readie to ouerrun him preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his refuſall: the ſea was couered with Spaniſh ſhips redy to inuade and fill all the hauens of France, preſently vpon the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall geuen: there were alſo Almaines and Switzers. It ſeemed that all people and Nations had forſaken their owne buſineſſe and homes for to come force her, or runne to her ruine, to her fall. Behold my king ſurpriſed and forced in the heart of his Realme, in the greateſt of his Cities, in the greateſt aboundance of his Subiects, by his owne foſter children, by them that had no good, nor honor, but through his fauour, and his predeceſſors: behold him forced to violate his faith, to ſweare and ſigne his owne death, his owne ende, and the ende of me, and of all his brothers my children, the ruine and wracke of his Realme, to plucke aſunder the foundations, and the lawes whereon it is grounded: behold him forced to diſpoſe his crowne to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of ſtrangers. Behold me preſently more tumultuous then cuer before: no ſpeech but of baniſhments, publications &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of outlawrie, of troubles and turmoiles. Ye may ſee many houſholders oppreſſed with yeeres and ſorowes, laden with children on their ſhoulders and at their ſides; their wiues folowing at their heeles blubbered with teares, hauing their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infants lugging at their breaſtes; abandoning their auncient and goodlie patrimonies, their purchaſes ſo agreeable, their houſes ſo commodious, their mouables ſo coſtlie: winding them ſelues at length out of the armes of their kinred, friendes, and neighbors, after they had ſuſteined the conflict with reaſons and conſiderations, had bedewed themſelues with teares, their bowels yerning, and heartes foreſpent with ſighes and ſobs; and albeit liuing, had deemed themſelues as dead one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had recommended themſelues to God: ſome trauailing towardes Germanie, others towardes England, perſwaded to finde more courteſie, charitie, pitie, mercie and ſuccour amid the wilde forreſtes of Almaine, amid the ſurges of the ſea, among them that are reputed naturall and ſworne foes of all French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than in their owne Realme, their natiue Soile, in their own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2735:6"/>Citie, of their owne king, of their owne Countriemen, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens. Euery one curſeth his chaunce, yea, they rather that tarie, than they that are gone, as bereft of the incredible comfort they receiued by the companie of their friends abſent. The wife hath loſt her husband, the mother her ſonne, being her ſtay; the brother his brother, being his ioy: the father in law forgoing his ſonne in lawe, muſt abide the charge of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters maintenance, ſhe neither maried, nor in ſtate to marrie. Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and amities are made voide, families are confounded. At the ſame inſtant beholde mee couered ouer with armies, in whom is found nor reſpect, nor mercie, nor law, nor faith: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but inſolence, but crueltie, but violence, &amp; trecherie; being in deede nought els ſaue a vacation, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armes, but for armes. They make warre as though they neuer hoped for, nor euer would haue peace; they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit violences and iniuries irreparable, they cauſe enmities irreco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilable: the Nobles know not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; as perſons meerly vnacquainted do deeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues no longer neighbours: there is no houſe be it noble or meane that is not ſhiuered in peeces, that is not betrayed, ſurpriſed, forced, and ſacked: finde me him out, that is not ſtreined and wringed as it were in a preſſe to extract from him his ſubſtance: the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are turmoiled for their pride; the man, the Prince, the King deſireth to be letten into his Citie, and can not. It ſeemes I am at an end, rather dead then aliue; they vſe me as if I were paſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; they make gaſhes in my skin on all partes, they make the ſcales leape from my bones: they labour not but to burie the dead, and ſinke the liuing in bottomles darknes; they build not, but to deſtroy other buildings: euery where are diches, trenches, mynes, troupes and bandes. But all this is but one of the actes of the Tragedie. Behold here the other partie ariſing vp, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to appeare, which is werie of retiring to beare of the blowes; it is more knowen and auowed with me then it was euernt conſiſteth of all my Princes what countenaunce ſoeuer they make, &amp; of a great number of my peaceabler children; they want not frends both within &amp; without the Realme, euen more then is ſuppoſed. They ſay, that all the Allemaignes, the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, the Engliſh, and Scotts are raiſed, armed, muſtred, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2735:7"/>for their cauſe, as if none ſhould reſt behind of all theſe nations in a maner ſaue old folke, women and children. If they ſhould bring as much euill will as power, without doubt I am vndone. Alas! I haue not life enough to ſuſtaine ſo mightie an aſſault of ſickneſſe. It behoueth by remedies to preuent the fit, it behoueth by good counſell to remoue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked all occaſion that may egge them on while they are yet not moued too much, nor banded together; hitherto they haue neither ſpoken nor done any thing, as more inclined to peace then warre: they reſtraine ſo much as they may the motions of their choler, &amp; th'execution of their power. Let me intreat you my children not to plead our cauſe by armes, not to hazard our ſelues on the doubtfull euents of battaile. Victories in ciuill warre bring no commoditie but to two or three; they vndo the reſt, and ſpecially the people. Otherwiſe how great ſoeuer the hap and aduantage of the victors be, they muſt alwayes come to agreement in th'end. Get he the maiſtrie, that may, I am deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euer. I feare the victory as much as confuſion; be the iſſue what it will, the French ſhalbe defeated. Come hither my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, harken to me; we may not doubt but that the wrath of God purſueth vs, ſeing the ſtripes he geueth vs: the peſtilence rageth within, the ſword without, the famine throughout, and theſe are but threats in compariſon of more boyſtrous blowes prepared by him for vs yet: leaue we our ſenceles obſtinacie, &amp; beſtow we our endeuour betweene the threat and ſtripe, &amp; the ſtripe ſhall not light; beſtow we our endeuour betweene ſtroke and ſtroke, the woundes ſhall ceaſe and turne to bleſſings. Let vs wittingly and in good earneſt know &amp; feele our owne euill, the cauſe thereof; let vs be humbled and ſearch out the remedie. Do ye not vnderſtand; that in one moneth of warre we offend more the diuine maieſtie, then in a whole age of peace? Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ye not that peace brings all good, warre all euill? If ye doubt it, marke the pictures and greetings of your anceſters, compare your diſcommodities with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Let vs ſeeke then this peace, &amp; to that end boldly &amp; peece meale try &amp; examine our euill &amp; enmities &amp; ſearch the remedy therefore: Let vs ſuck out the ſenſe, &amp; ſwalow the wiſe ſentence.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue broken the peace ſo ſolemnely ſworne (I ſpeake to you my children, that haue bene indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to begin this warre) ye haue falſed your faith, ye haue taken the name of God in vayne: for that (ſay you) a man neither may nor ſhould promiſe nor keepe faith towards heretickes and Infidels, according to the reſolution taken and practiſed in the Councell of Conſtance Anno. 1414. &amp; againe according to th'aduiſe and commaundement executed by Pope Eugenius the fourth to Vladiſlaus king of Hungary., about xxx. yeares afterward. Ye ſay, this is a doctrine receiued ſo ſolemnly, confirmed by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons &amp; auctorities, approued by ſo many actes, continued by ſo many yeares, that now it is no tyme to doubt thereof. My children, this defenſe can not warrant you from vices and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reproches damnable before God &amp; men. For if ye bring in and ſo freely receiue ſuch diſtinctions in promiſes and othes, ye open a gap to all maner of miſeries &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſions in all Eſtates but principally in this Realme, where are few houſes, families, townes, cities &amp; gouernements, few companies publick or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that are not bound by ſuch othes, few or no mariages, ſucceſſions, felowſhips, and other couenantes, whoſe ſuit, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinement, and aſſurance depend not on ſuch othes. For in all theſe things they that we haue called heretickes be confuſedly intermedled with the Catholikes. So that I may ſay with truth, there is no humane wit nor might, which would not ſooner melt and conſume, then be able to preſerue this Realme, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by obſeruing that hath bene bene couenaunted and ſworne. Moreouer, if ye be reſolute to practiſe this doctrine, ye ſhall make all our warres endeleſſe and immortall, as well ciuill and domeſticall for the reaſons afore touched, as the warres we may haue with the ſtranger be it the Switzer, Almain, Fleming, Engliſh, Scot, Spaniard, Italian, or Turke: for in manner all our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2735:8"/>neighbors doo differ in religion from vs, and conſequently he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes or Infidels in our opinion, &amp; perhaps they alſo eſteeme vs for ſuch. Who then will treate with you concerning peace knowing this your reſolution? They will rather chooſe to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, or make you miſcary vnder the chargeable toile and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of warre, then bee choked in the nets of your diſloyaltie. But how will ye excuſe your ſelues towards God? If it be euill done to promiſe faith to the Reformed, wherefore haue yee ſworne to them ſo ſolemly by actes often reiterated, and by long ſpaces of time diſtinguiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ye alleage, they compelled you: ye can not auerre nor iuſtifie this compulſion: yee haue alwaies bene maiſters of the field, of the townes and gouernments, and which is to be noted, the moſt part of the Pacifications haue bin made in their greateſt weakeneſſe. If it were impietie to agree with them, yee ſhould haue ſooner ſuffred a thouſand deaths, then done it. If yee ſay, it was done to make them difarme, and afterward to ſurpriſe and deſtroy them, to th'aduancement and exaltation of your religion, as many beleeue: yee are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons ſo to profane the othe, which God hath ordained for a witneſſe and aſſurance of the truth, for an end of all vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for renewing of charitie offended, and reſtabliſhment of peace and reſt among men: ye make it a bait for lying, for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and cruelty: yee ſhall not aſcend into Gods holy hill, for ye ſweare in deceipt. The Romains in their auncient faſhion of ſwearing and contracting alliances, were wont to ſay, ô Iupiter ſmite &amp; with thy lightening blaſt him, whoſoeuer in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhall haue brought hither an intent to beguile his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: what? muſt Pagans with more holineſſe deale in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oth then we? Ye take not alone the name of God in vaine, but ye alſo defile it ſo much as in you lieth, making it the auctor and protector of your murderous diſloyalties: yee thinke yee may ſport with mens liues by your othes; it is with God, with his glorious and magnificent name, and with your owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that yee ſport, it is your owne ſaluation that yee loſe: ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to draw men on to their death, &amp; make them fall on the poynt of your weapons lurking in the pit of your treaſons, yee draw on your owne heads the curſe of God, and plunge your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2735:8"/>ſelues head long in the fearefull dungion of darkeneſſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall woe. No euill ought to be done that good ſhould come of it. The very Paynims could ſay, that no religion is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by miſchieuous wickedneſſe: faithleſneſſe is an impe of impietie: impietie is directly oppoſite to religion: then mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous is their errour that thinke to vphold and augment reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion through impietie. Yee condemne the iudge that with his oth promiſeth impunitie to malefactors, prouided that they confeſſe and acknowledge the crimes they are accuſed of, yee diſanull all his proceſſe &amp; reuerſe it as erronious: thus by your owne ſentence yee incurre condemnation, in that by othe yee haue aſſured reſt and peace to the Reformed, to the end that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing abandoned their defences yee might afterward murther them by ſurpriſe and with more aduantage. Neither can yee alſo pretend excuſe by ignorance, as not knowing the nullitie of your othes at the time ye ſware: for the doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alleaged by your ſelues, are of a date far more ancient then the troubles and Pacifications of this Realme. Moreouer, after your goodly fearch for that holeſome doctrine, to warrant you from ſhame and reproch, vpon the breach that yee made of the former Pacifications, yee haue againe notwithſtanding treated and ſworne peace with them manifold times, &amp; that with more banning if yee brake it, then euer afore. But the likelihood is great, that your violation of the peace comes not through reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: more credible it is, that your vnreconcileable enmities, &amp; greedy aſpiring mindes are the cauſe: ſo that yee ſpeake for God in fraud, and plead for him in iniquitie: yee enterpriſe to make the holy Scripture ſtoupe to the windes of your will, and bende to the billowes &amp; tempeſts of your naughty paſſions; yee force it to ſerue your commodities, and fit your purpoſes, to execute your r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uenges, and ſatisfie your ambition and auarice. Let vs ſee notwithſtanding if the doctrine yee propoſe is ſo neceſſary and certaine as ye make it. I graunt you, and aduow it that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oth ought not to be obſerued, ſpecially when the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes therevpon the performance of ſome hainous ſinne, and doth directly preiudice the free paſſage of Gods word, which we all are bound to ſeeke: but reſeruing theſe two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2735:9"/>aboue, we may in all things els giue our faith vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to any whoſoeuer, &amp; being once giuen, we ought to keepe it. So that when we contend not directly againſt Gods glory and our owne ſaluation, faith muſt be obſerued. Now the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with Heretiks and Infidels, by letting them liue in peace and quiet without attempting them by materiall armes, do not hinder the hope of our ſaluation nor offend the glory &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God, when we are vnable to cut them of by the ordinary way and power of the magiſtrate, eaſily and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble &amp; detriment to the Church. For though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the law, that the Heretike be cut of, which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a more ſtrong reaſon forbidding to conuerſe or deale with an heretike: that ought to be vnderſtood, when we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly deſtroy or expell him, not diſturbing the Church. It is more tollerable, more reaſonable, and agreable to Gods pleaſure, to ſuffer the heretike and infidell to liue, and dwell by him, then to make hauock in the Church, and ſet a way wide open to a thouſand &amp; a thouſand confuſions, impieties, &amp; other miſchieuous villanies which warres brings with it, &amp; leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, namely warre Ciuill. This is that, which the Patriarch of Conſtantinople named Atticus, ſaid vpon the like occaſion: that we muſt ſometimes vpon ſome neceſſitie, holde vs content with that which hapneth not to our liking, that we muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preferre vtilitie before ſtrict iuſtice, ſometime encline to agreement, to the peace and tranquilitie of the people: prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the peace of a Realme, the peace of all the world, before the preciſe obſeruation of the wordes, after the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that wiſely diſpenced with occaſions and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Better it is then to continue the vlcer open, than cloſe it vp to the hazard of the whole bodie. Better it is to ſtrike ſaile in the ſtorme, than ſtriue too gloriouſlie againſt it, and make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke: wee muſt hate the heretike, but yet our loue to the Church muſt excell our hatred towards him. Scipio, and after him the Emperour Antonine the meeke ſaid, they had leifer ſaue one Citizen, than ſlay a thouſande enemies: what? ſhould my king, my princes &amp; you, beare leſſe affection to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and to the Church, then they bare to their Countrey alone?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2735:9"/>That which I tell you is confirmed by the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> who forbids the rooting vp of the tares and darnel gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing among the good corne, leſt the good corne chaunce to be ſpoyled or pluckt vp withall. This parable of our Sauiour rightlie conceiued, anſwereth whatſoeuer ye can obiect. If yee ſay, the libertie of Gods word and his glorie ſeeme to be leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on that part the heretiks make and hold in an Eſtate: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye may be tolde how the grouth of the good corne is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in that part of the fielde which the darnell poſſeſſeth; and conſequently, the owners credit and profit: yet neuertheleſſe doth Ieſus Chriſt ſay, it muſt not be pluckt vp. It ſufficeth then to conſider that otherwiſe it may not be, and that the glorie of God will be more obſcured in the totall hauok &amp; confuſion of the Church, than in a ſmall anoyance which the neerenes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes may bring to it: alſo that Gods glorie, and the power of his word will more brightlie ſhine amid our diſcommodities, infirmities and diſhabilities, then in our eaſe, and the force of our fleſh, of which he vſeth verie little or none towardes the building and conſeruation of his Church. The politiks adde, that the ſoueraigne lawe, the moſt equal rule of all, from which Magiſtrates and Counſellers of eſtate ought neuer to ſwerue, is to preferre the publike ſafegard before all other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; conſiderations, that may be propounded for the greater aſſurance of one of the members of the ſtate. For as they ſay, all commeth to nought when the Common-weale goes to wrack. We read, that by recital of this only law, the Conſul Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilius ſtaied the courſe of the moſt pernitious ſedition that euer came within the walles of Rome. They adde alſo this neceſſarie doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, that euery Realme diuided in it ſelfe ſhalbe deſolate. Behold, for what cauſe in the yeere 1561, it was concluded at S. German, by the greateſt wits, and wiſeſt heads of this Realme, that it was expedient, not only to quench the fires, and make the purſuites commenced in the name of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the reformed, to ceaſe; but alſo, that peace might and ought to be made with them. Behold alſo, wherefore al the ſoueraigne Courts of this Realme, after they had ripely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on this difficult point, were reſolued to approue the edict
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2735:10"/>of Ianuarie. True it is that the Parliament of Paris made more difficultie then the other: howbeit they alſo were reſolued, after they had heard the holy, politik, and learned declarations of the Chanceller Hoſpital, whoſe lack I cannot ſufficiently lament, waying what neede I haue at this day of ſuch perſonages. For the ſelfe ſame reaſons haue the Emperors of Germanie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſworne peace with the Proteſtants their Subiects, and to this preſent haue kept their faith to them. We reade alſo in the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, that the Emperours, Valerian, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imian, Conſtantine, and many others, to compound the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions betweene the Chriſtians and Ethnikes their Subiectes; in whoſe power conſiſted the maintenance or decay not onely of the ſtate, but of religion alſo, did permit to the one &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the exerciſe of their religion. If this were a matter ſo ſtrange, as ye ſay, to enter into couenants with the reformed, &amp; to geue them your faith, the Emperor Charles the fifth had not ſo often geuen and vſed it as he did in his ſafeconducts to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to Melancthon, to Bucer, and to many others: it is hard to reckon how many times he receiued into his Courts the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes and their Doctors, to common and conferre with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; he might haue cauſed them to be murthered if he had liſted, he wanted not aduiſe thereto, for there were Lords inow about him, that laboured earneſtly to draw him to that treacherie. Nay, what ſay you to this of greater efficacie? Euen the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent decreed concerning paſſe-ports and ſafeconducts for the Proteſtants, of whom ſome appeared, and made their orations, and returned ſafely. I finde on euery ſide plenty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that vrge and condemne you moſt apparantly. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Switzers were not ſcrupulous to enter into league with the Reformed Switzers, &amp; which was more, with them of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua. Your ſelues are confederate with all the Cantons of the Switzers, and ye ſolicite them dayly to enterteine this aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ye are alied by couenantes ſworne with all the Princes of Germanie aſwell Proteſtantes as others: our kings Francis the firſt and Henry the ſecond haue particularly ſought th'alliance of the Proteſtantes, haue ſent to that end their Ambaſſadours into Germany to the generall Diets of the Proteſtantes, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2735:10"/>de Lange amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g others came for that purpoſe by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſaid king Francis to th'aſſembly at Smalcalde: our kings with their armies haue entred Germany againſt th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for the defence and protection of the Proteſtants. Ye are likewiſe alied with the Engliſh, and with the Netherlanders, whoſe protection moreouer againſt the Spaniard your ſelues haue vndertaken. Examples ſhould lead vs thus farreforth; if we would apply our myndes to reuiew them we ſhould not finde any eſtate on earth, where agreements haue not bene made with them of different Religion, &amp; conſequently with or among he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes and infidels: for two diuers Religions can not both be true. The Pope hath often couenanted with the Turke &amp; with Iewes, being both vndoubted Infidels. The Venetian treateth and ordinarily ſweareth peace with the Turke. The Spainard dayly bargaineth with infidels as well in Affrik, as in India and in the New found world. All antiquirie and the Primitiue Church do afford vs alſo great ſtore of like preſidents, as thoſe I haue mentioned of th'Emperours Valerius, Maximian, and Conſtantius.

Aſſurances are geuen indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to all heretiks for their apparance at Councels: thither do they come, and from thence they returne with ſecuritie; of ſuch importance is the faith graunted them by ſafeconduct. We read that eight or ten Emperours after the great Conſtantine, onely to keepe the Church and people in peace, did permit th'Arians to haue Biſhops and Temples, ſo that euery towne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt had two Biſhops, th'one an Arian, th'other a Catholike; now had they an Arian Pope, and anon a Catholik Pope.

Roboam hauing attempted it was letted, and by the commaundement of God retired from th'enterpriſe;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11</note> and whatſoeuer the hereſie and ſchiſme of the ten Tribes was, yet were th'other two Tribes conſtreined to liue with &amp; nigh them in alliance and confederacie. Behold how your doctrine is not ſo certeine as you report, nor yet preſcribed by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall cuſtome: And that preſcription hath no place, when the queſtion is of doctrine, of right, and of truth. But reſolue we it further by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the ſacred Scripture. We learne in the ſame, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſware aliance with many vnbeleeuing Princes &amp; peoples: with others then vnbeleeuers he could not contract, ſith he was th'onely elect from among all the families and nations of the earth.

Digeſt we perfectly the hiſtory of the Gabaonites, and that alone will ſatisfie vs with the truth vpon euery poinct of this queſtion. The Gabaonites a people of the Amorrheans amaſed at the multitude,

Theſe contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feict Ambaſſadours declared, that they were not of the land of Canaan, but came from farre, ſo that in their long voyage they had worne, ſpent and conſumed their garments, victuals and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; they offred &amp; required alliance, it was receiued &amp; graunted; Ioſua and the people ſware it in the name of God. Three dayes after, th'Iſraelits came into the countrey of the Gabaonits, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finding the deceipt were greatly amaſed and prouoked, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering firſt of all, that God had commanded them not to leaue aliue any one of all the nations of Canaan, &amp; namely th'Amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhi:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2735:11"/>howbeit afterwards hauing conſulted on this matter, they ſmote them not; they durſt not; ſaying, we haue ſworne to them by the name of the Lord God. About foure hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the Iſraelites vnder the conduct of Saul,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 21.</note> egged on with zele and deuotion, made warre on the Gabaonits and ſlew ſome of them: God puniſhed th'Iſraelites, viſited them by famine: the Prophetes anſwered that God viſited the people, for the finne they had committed, in warring on them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 9.</note> for whom they were bound by oth: the famine continued three yeeres &amp; cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not till after ſubmiſſion, acknowledgement and ſatisfaction made by Dauid to the Gabaonites at their diſcretion: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Princes of the lignage of Saul, Dauid deliuered them ſeuen; they crucified them to the Lord; the famine ceaſed. They, whom you terme Huguenots, are no more Infidels or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, then the Gabaonites that worſhipped idols and the deuil: you haue not ſo expreſſe commaundement of God to deſtroy them, as the people of Iſrael had to deſtroy the Gabaonites: they had by ſuddaine aduantage, lying &amp; guile, robbed and extorted the peace, alliance, and oth of th'Iſraelites: I do not ſee that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſurprized, deceiued, or ouerreached you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you promiſed and ſwore them the Peace. Againe, Iſrael was puniſhed for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the othe made by his aunceſtors, he infringed it not but foure hundred yeeres after the faith was giuen, he might haue imputed the fault to forgetfulnes. How much more worthy of puniſhment are yee, yee that haue violated the oth, which your ſelues haue made, ye that haue falſified it irreparably within three or foure years after; I dare ſay, that ye haue not kept it one whole day: for as good it is to make warre, as prepare for warre. What know ye, but that the curſes which threaten you, which hang ouer your heads, hem in &amp; diſtreſſe you at this inſtant on euery part, in your perſons, in your houſes &amp; families &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, are ſo many aduertiſements ſent from God, warning you to make him &amp; them amends for your diſloy altic. If ye open your mouth to ſay that th'Iſraelites had another reaſon beſides th'oth not to breake the aliance made with the Gabaonites, ye belye the holy Ghoſt, who ſtops your mouth when he tels you, how the Princes ſaid: we may not touch them for that we haue ſworne to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2735:12"/>them by the Lord God of Iſrael; and againe where it is ſaid; the Prophets anſwered, that God viſited the people, for their offence in making warre on them, to whom they were bound by oth. If ye ſay that the reaſon holdeth not betweene a Prince &amp; his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes: beſides that this ſtale ſubtiltie is to be laughed at, ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more of a courtly paraſite, then of a teacher &amp; profeſſor of the truth;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſua.</hi> 9.</note> marke here that the Gabaonites were ſubiects to the people of Iſrael, and ſerued them in cutting wood and drawing water; they were, I ſay; their vaſſals by a title moſt iuſt, for God had geuen them to the Iſraelites from that day where in he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all Canaan: neuertheleſſe Saul their King and all Iſrael were puniſhed, for violating the faith geuen them. Againe, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betweene othes made by a Prince to his ſubiectes, and othes made to others, is conuinced by the examples of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the primitiue Church afore alleaged, in that they licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the ſelfe ſame time, in the ſelfe ſame townes, to Pagans, Arians, and Chriſtians the ſeuerall exerciſes of their religions; and yet further by the faith geuen and well kept of Conſtantine the great to Arius, as alſo by the Pacifications ſworne and duly obſerued of the Germane Emperours to the Proteſtants. For in all theſe caſes, the Prince promiſed and ſwore to his ſubiect. But returne we to the examples of the ſacred Scripture. We read how the people of Iſrael againſt the generall commaundement of God,
<note place="margin">

Sedeehias and Achab were kings of Iſrael the people of God. Thus haue Gods people geuen faith to Pagans, and kept it, and haue bene chaſtiſed of God for preſuming to breake it: there is as good reaſon at leaſt to keepe faith to them that are reputed hereticks; for the hereticke is not more abhominable then the Pagan and Infidell: ad withall the hiſtories aboue cited, iuſtifying the like obſeruation of loyaltie towards heretickes conuict and deemed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2735:12"/>ſuch. We ſweare, we hold vp our hands to God: now ſince it is to God that wee ſweare and not to men, why then doo we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the qualitie of men? Let vs not therefore ſtay vpon the qualitie of perſons, euen as our ſelues deſire of the Lord to performe vs his promiſes, without regard to our vnworthines: for the holy Ghoſt likewiſe in all th'examples of promiſes wel kept, yeldeth this onely reaſon for all; one or other hath ſworne. It becommeth vs not raſhly to ſlippe aſide from the charge of Gods commandements. We ſhal enioy more reſt, honour, and libertie in ſeruing God, than by ſhifting off our ſhoulders the yoke of his lawes. The commandement is manifeſt; Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine: it is noted, that this is a principall commandement of the law, one of thoſe two that haue a threatning penaltie annexed, I wil not holde him guiltleſſe, ſaith he, that taketh my name in vaine. The religion of an othe hath euermore, and euery where bene eſteemed to haue ſuch power ouer the conſciences, honor and reputation of men, that after an othe taken, none durſt doubt of the trueth of matters depoſed or ſworne. An othe determineth the whole variance, it is vnchangeable, as ſaith S. Paul.

Periured perſons are noted, hated and ſhunned, as well of them that feele the damage of their faithleſneſſe, as of them to whom profite comes by their periurie, if any profite may come of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie. The Aegyptians, to declare how much they deteſted faithleſſe perſons, digreſſed from their generall rules, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie iuſtice: for it was a ground in their law to puniſh each of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, in that part or member, which was chiefe inſtrument of th'offence: and ſo it ſhould haue ſufficed them onely to plague the tongue of the periured; neuertheleſſe, they put him to death, vtterlie excluding all ranſome of his life for anie price whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

Thus you venture to perſeuere in a ſinne intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to God &amp; man, the razer of religion and humane felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye wil perhaps replie, that ſince the pacifications, ye haue ſworne other contrarie othes, from which later othes, by a more ſtrong reaſon ye may not depart: but I wil reſerue the aſſoyling of this your obiection, to the concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Meane while let vs examine the groundes, whereon the maine ſtay of your doctrine propoſed doeth ſtande, and we ſhall finde them rotten and ruinous. Let vs conſider what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the king of Hungarie, and al Chriſtendome, for hauing too ſimply obeyed Pope Eugenius. This king of Hungarie had fought with, daunted, and vanquiſhed the Turke: had compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to make a peace honourable, beneficiall, aduantageable,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2735:13"/>and conuenient for all Chriſtendome: howbeit, by commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Pope, for the conſiderations aforeſaid, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from that peace, he violated his faith and promiſe geuen; he denounced warre to Amurath, he preſented himſelfe in fielde better aſſiſted tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before; both with men &amp; with hope, they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in fight; he loſt the battell; 30. thouſand of his ſoldiers were deuoured by the ſword, himſelfe there ſlaine, his head carried on a Launces point along all the Countrie: the Turke gaue not armes ouer, till he had waſted, and by conqueſt diſmembred from Chriſtendome the Empire of Greece, Hungarie, a portion of high Germanie and ſundrie other Countries, the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate being bringer of this gay doctrine, was ſtrangely deſcried, and ſlaine when he deemed himſelfe out of danger, hauing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the brunt of the battell. Such euents weighed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the commandements of God, &amp; th'examples here afore produced, which certifie vs of his will, may make one iudge religiouſlie enough, that God was diſpleaſed at their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerend regard of his name, and that thereby he would teach and make vs vnderſtand, that faith ſhould be holden more deare of vs than all worldlie things. We haue as good reaſon after ſo manie miſeries heard, ſeene and felt, in religion and temporall affaires throughout all Europe, as well in generall as particular, to thinke that they haue happened in all or in part, bycauſe of the infidelitie executed with crueltie againſt them, who vnder the faith of the Potentats of Chriſtendome preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues at the Councell of Conſtance, with intention &amp; hope not to cope with th'aduerſarie or defende their cauſe but by the word of God; and further ſithence that time againſt an infinite number of Chriſtians that haue diſloyally bene marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Germany, Fraunce, Spaine, Italy, in England, Scotland, Flanders and other countreys. What know we whether the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of warre and other notable calamities that haue be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len certeine Lords of our time, are ſo many puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their deſloyaltie? We ſee their miſfortunes, neither can we be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their trecherie, &amp; we know elſwhere the wretched ends of the periured, as of Liſander, Hannibal, Siphax, Caracalla, and of Hebert th'Earle of Vermandois, of th'Earles of Charolois &amp;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2735:14"/>Saint Paul, and of others innumerable. A Iew of this our age hath imputed all the miſeries wherein thoſe of his nation are wrapped, to their faithleſnes. Vnworthy is he the reputation of a faithful Chriſtian, that will violate his faith &amp; makes no reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it: vnworthy is he to receiue faith of God, or finde faith among men, that knowes not how to keepe it. They ſay that ſinne is knowen by its trayne, that ſinne is the penaltie of ſinne: but chiefly that is verified of faithleſnes. To this purpoſe do the Hebrues aduiſe men aboue all to beware of this vice: for hauing crept once into their acquaintance, by and by it growes fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, cuſtomary and domeſticall. We haue obſerued that euer ſince this doctrine was receiued in ſo great a Synod of Biſhops, vnfaithfull diſloyalty hath borne ſway in all that hath byn done or treated among all the Potentats of Chriſtendome; &amp; among all Chriſtians welnigh: the Biſhops are the chief heades thereof, the euill from thence is deſcended to the members, and ſo from member to member throughout the whole body. I ſhame to ſay, how ſince ye haue receiued and practiſed this goodly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ye haue mortgaged or rather forfeicted the honour and commendation of troth and fidelitie purchaſed ſo dearely and carefully amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all nations by your predeceſſours. Ye are at this day among all nations as a veſſell wherein is no pleaſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, nor aſſurance. Ye reteine the ſolemnitie of othes by cuſtome, ye leaue the truth by malice. Shame will not ſuffer me to purſue this point any further. Yet one thing will I add, that faithleſneſſe iuſtly bringes the faithleſſe perſon in ſuſpect that he fayles in faith towardes Ieſus Chriſt: for as one of the ancientes ſayd none loſeth his faith, ſaue he that had it not. Then my children, ye that are Chriſtians by the grace of God, geue no place to Paynims in vertuous actes, which nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, law, cuſtome, neceſſitie, and your ſoueraigne Lord God do inioyne you ſo expreſly: folow the examples propounded by the holy Ghoſt to fortifie you againſt the ſubtil quirks &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh: beleeue it not to be permitted which God forbiddeth and with indignation puniſheth: eſchue not his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The holy Ghoſt is the chief workemaiſter in building the Church, let him controll vs, let the meanes that he hath taught conduct vs: we can not be ignorant if we but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how he hath proceded euer ſince the creation of the world to the building of the Church the houſe of God. He would neuer be ſerued with the violence of men, of fire, of ſword, and of the halter to compell men to enter into the Church. Adam, Seth, and Enos enforced not Cain to returne to God after he was plunged in diſpayre, when he had forſaken God, his countrie, and conſequently the Church by reaſon of his ſinne. Noe vſed not weapons to compell the people to turne to God, but praiers and preachings in the name of the Lord, he laboured to conuert them by words and examples of godlines, he manaced them not with his owne wrath, or with his owne armes, but with the wrath and armes of th'Almighty. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham longed with all his hart to ſee th'effect of Gods promiſes, he ſaw in ſpirit already the Church filled with nations innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he beheld about him great power, he fought, he ouercame, but yet he neuer attempted to bring men to God by armes. The children of Iſrael fought, vanquiſhed, conquered, and deſtroied many nations: yet where can ye finde that they went about to conſtraine one onely man of ſo many peoples to ſuffer their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and become one of their Church? if they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to th'Ammonits, Moabites, Philiſtins, and to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians which would haue yeelded to all conditions of peace, for to liue peaceably by them, thus: wee will leaue you in peace in your houſes and families among your wiues and children, we will leaue you your goods, your townes and dominions; proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ye renounce your idolatrie, &amp; receiue our law, the law of the Lord: if not, we will continually purſue by armes your end and deſtruction: how many Proſelits thinke you had they

But they knew that feare and force were not workemen of the houſe of God. We can not doubt of the power of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; he is God: we can not doubt of his tender loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs and th'edification of his Church, he humbled himſelfe infinitely, being God he tooke vpon him humane nature, and ſubmitted himſelfe to the miſeries of the fleſh, except ſinne, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering reproches, torments, and death, euen the curſe of God his father for our ſaluation; he praied, preached, and wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles for th'edification of the Church: with one twinkling of an eye, with one onely word he might haue compelled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all men, he might haue fought with twelue legions of Angels if it had bene his pleaſure, he might haue done to all as he did to S. Paul; he did it not. He forbad them that meant to vſe force, he lifted not vp his hand, he handled no ſword nor warlike weapon, his will was not that armes ſhould intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the kingdome of the word. Thus we may not bring men to the houſe of God but by means allowed by Ieſus Chriſt, for none can go to God but by him, he is the doore of the houſe of God. The Apoſtles alſo haue witneſſed to vs their earneſt deſire, in that they abandoned the world &amp; themſelues for our example, and to winne vs bare with our infirmities, obiected themſelues to all daungers, drad not th'aſſaults of the deuill, the hate of the world, the rigor of Magiſtrats, the ſtormes of the ſea, the paine, ignominie and terror of puniſhments, no not the

Euen ſo did the Lord rebuke his Apoſtles that craued leaue of him to pray for fire to fall downe from heauen on ſuch as would not receiue them: yee know not (quoth he) of what ſpirit ye are; for the ſonne of man came not to deſtroy ſoules, but to ſaue them. Prayers therefore, preachings, prophecies, interpretations, writinges, miracles and ſufferinges were the tooles wherewith th'Apoſtles built the houſe of God. Yours are of a farre other ſort; they humbled themſelues, yee exalt your ſelues; they prayed, yee curſe, and commaund; they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, expounded, and writ, yee ſay not a word, yee ſhut, yee hide the booke, yee write with the ſword: they ſuffered, yee make others ſuffer, they were murthered, yee are maſſacrers. Thus haue ye forſaken the way of our Sauiour &amp; his Diſciples. Take heed that it be not told you, that you folow in this behalf the way of Mahumet. Mahumet ſaid he was the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſent of God to conſtraine by violence of armes all thoſe that would not ſubmit themſelues vnder the power of God by the preaching of his word, &amp; to that purpoſe God had ſent him three keyes, of Iuſtice, of Prophecie, and of Victory. Great is the appearance that this noueltie of forcing mens conſciences is come out of Sathans ſhop. For beſides the noueltie thereof and ſlat repugnance againſt the doctrine and hiſtories of the Bible, it carieth th'infallible marke of Sathan, th'executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belyeth the promiſe. Ye promiſe your ſelues to compell mens conſciences and ſo bring them to God, which can not be. It is notorious that the materiall ſword hath no power ouer the ſoule. Ye may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the body to be preſent at the Maſſe, to bow it ſelf before your inuentions, your images and relikes, but ye can not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the conſcience to conſent to theſe bowings and ſeruices. It is as if ye would weigh the firie flame. The more ye aſſay to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2735:17"/>compell and enthrall the conſcience, the more free it remaines. The Martyrs that were violently forced to ſtand by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Idols, were not Pagans therefore. So they that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion become Chriſtians, are nothing leſſe then Chriſtians. But admit ye could force mens conſciences, ſuppoſe ye by this meane to bring them to God? Ye, whoſe might and knowledge can not reach ſo farre as to the will of man, yet do not accept a frend fayned or forced, ye make no accompt in your houſes and Lordſhips of ſubmiſſions or homages founded on diſſimuled pretence or fearefull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint: God that will principally reigne ouer our wils, and full well knoweth them, that deſerueth and demaundeth to be loued of vs with all our heart, with all our will, with all our ſtrength, with all our ſoule &amp; with all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will he receiue theſe forced ſoules which ye bring him? Chriſtian Religion conſiſteth in faith: nothing is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to faith then force: ye may compell me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do, or to ſpeake, but to make them to beleeue ye are neuer able. Whoſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, can not be a Chriſtian.

For ſomuch then as we neither ought nor may build in the houſe of God with armes, and that we muſt build with the word of God, which is all ſufficient, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and commaunded: let vs not diſſobey th'auctoritie of the ſacred Scripture, the commaundements of our ſoueraigne God, the conduct of his holy ſpirite; according to th'example of of our Lord, of his Apoſtles and of his Church: arme we our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with the word of God, the ſword of the ſpirite, with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, patience, and holines of life: build we the Church euery one of vs to th'vttermoſt extent of his abilitie with theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

But now me thinks I heare you ſay: what neede more wordes? theſe two caſes are now cleare and vndoubted; the one, that we ſhould not enterpriſe to force mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the other, that Clergie men ſhould not ſeeke the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church otherwiſe than by ſpirituall armes: but by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2735:18"/>this diſcourſe, or any other, I cannot conceiue that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is prohibited to deſtroy the body of an heretike or ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike: and conſequently, that our king is not permitted to employ his armes and armies againſt the Reformed, which are reputed ſuch. I graunt you in ſome ſort, that the text of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt afore cited to this purpoſe, ſeemeth more to bind the Eccleſiaſtical perſon, than the Magiſtrate. But that which I haue diſcourſed to you, how the Church from Adam to Chriſt, neuer vſed the force of fleſh and bloud, and of material armes, for to multiplie and augment it ſelfe, and for to ruine the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in deteſtation of their naughtie religion, makes directlie aſwel againſt the Magiſtrate as the Churchman. For ſo much as Adam, Seth, Enos, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, were not onelie Patriarkes, but alſo were kings, Gouernors and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of peoples. Ioſua, the Iudges, and kings of Iſrael, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyned from ſuch violence in behalfe of their borderers, had the right of magiſtracie ouer them, as alredie hath bene noted. Notwithſtanding, it ſhall not be amiſſe to treate more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly touching this power of the Magiſtrate ouer heretikes and infidels. But firſt I take it for confeſſed, that our Eccleſiaſticall perſons are guiltie of great error and enormitie at this inſtant, in that they manage and imploy materiall armes, inioyne and ſweare euery one to put on armour for the ruine of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſetting ſorth and leading in their owne perſons the bands of men of warre, yea whole armies. About whoſe heads ye may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſee their weapons flouriſh with as much pride hatred and furie, as the moſt barbarous Seculars can ſhew. Proceed we then to the power of the Magiſtrate. Firſt the reformed wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you (for their bookes &amp; actions approue, that ſuch is their doctrine and diſcipline) how the Magiſtrate hath a iuſt &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vocation from God, to condemne and put to death the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike and ſchiſmatike; and that if he neglect or refuſe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this his duetie, being able to performe the ſame, he then miſregardeth and offendeth the law of God and his owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and deſerueth blame and puniſhment. But withall they affirme and mainteine, that before the magiſtrate proceedeth to ſuch executions, he muſt patiently heare them that are ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2735:19"/>of hereſie or ſchiſme, they muſt cauſe them to be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the word of God, in holy, aſſured, and free aſſemblies, perſwade them, pray for them, with patience awaite Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for their conuerſion; and after, if they perſiſt ſtill, then is it not onely lawfull, but alſo neceſſarie, to deliuer them ouer to death: they affirme alſo, that as for themſelues, they were neuer called nor heard in a Counſel free and aſſured for them: they haue not bene conuinced by holy Scripture: that when ye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, it was onely to heare their condemnation: the Iudges to whom ye ſent them were deafe, and truſted rather to loude clamors, than ſound arguments. Againe, that when yee haue conferred with them, ye haue made exception to th'authoritic of Gods word, according to which word they haue got th'up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand in all that hath bene propounded: that ye haue delayd &amp; croſt the diſputations &amp; conferences, as fearing to be vtterly conuinced, and being required ye would not returne: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſay they, that ye could not abide the light of the trueth which was ſet before your eyes: that therefore ye ſhrunke aſide and hid your heads, not daring to appeare but with playne or priuie force. All which allegations they offer to verifie by the vnpartiall hiſtories, and autentike records of this time, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the affaires of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wel in Germanie as in this Realm, and elſwhere throughout Europe. Now for my part, touching this power of the Magiſtrate, I pray you conſider, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel commaunds not the death of heretikes and infidels ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly as the law. According to the law they muſt not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to liue til the morow: but by the Goſpel, patience &amp; long tarying is chieflie preſcribed in ſuch purſuites, as appeareth by the places aboue cited, and ſpeciallie by the anſwere of Ieſus Chriſt to th'Apoſtles S. Iames and S. Iohn, and by the doctrine of S. Paul.
<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Law. It is written in S. Matthew, if he hearkeneth not to thee,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> tell it the Church, and if he hearkeneth not to the Church, let him be to thee as an Ethnik and Publican: it is not written, deliuer him into the hands of the Iuſtice, or of th'Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2735:19"/>it is leſſe written, maſſacre him. S. Paul ſaith, in the times of hereſies, watch, trauaile, doo the worke of an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt: he ſaith not, make leagues and conſpiracies, commaund and muſtre armies, diſpatch al with th'edge of the ſword. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of peruerſe heretikes was great in the Apoſtles time, their writings are full of complaints againſt them. But what! Did they therefore runne to theſe extremities of rayſing powers to roote them out? No, they puniſhed a fewe, to reſtraine the reſt not by the ſword which was forbidden them, but by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull power of the word. Theſe extraordinarie actes are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for our ordinarie Magiſtrates, whenſoeuer they meet with multitudes infected with hereſie: firſt to vſe lenitie, leaſure and labour, to winne them all if it may be, than to puniſh the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretikes by death, to the terror of the reſidue, and euermore, to beware that he make no generall executions. For ſo ſhal he imitate th'Apoſtles adminiſtration of iuſtice in caſes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nay he ſhal imitate his Lord God, who if he ſometimes ſend ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on a few for their wickednes &amp; misbeleef, yet doth he long time &amp; patiently abide the conuerſion of innumerable others. Again how know we the time of Gods calling; the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth not peculiarly now a dayes to any certain natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the gate lies open to all; he brings into his vineyard ſome in the morning, others at noone, and ſome at night. If the people of God had in old time deſtroyed all the Gentils, they had withall deſtroyed ſo many Churches, which ſince haue bene gathered of Gentils. How know we, whether he that is at this day an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike or ſchiſmatike, ſhall be ſo an yeare hence? How know we whether God will call his children, neuewes, or his neuewes children? He that had conſumed with fire the townes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope infected with Arianiſme for certaine hundred yeeres, how much had he hindered the kingdome of our Sauiour, the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the number of the faithfull, ſeing that out of thoſe Townes the Lord hath taken &amp; daily doth take ſome to finiſh his accompt? If ye tell me, that all lewd perſons guilty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict of other crimes may ſtand on thoſe pretences, to auoyd or make blunt the Magiſtrates ſword: I will anſwere you, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene hereſie and other common crimes th'ods is very great.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2735:20"/>For the heretike put to death without pauſe, ſeemeth to die in a harde caſe, and few there are of them that make ſhew of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance while breath is in their bodie: and no maruaile. For their hearts are ſo hardened, that they had rather leaue their life then their opinion. And can ye perſuade them to repent, who will acknowledge no offence? As for other malefactors, their crimes are open to their conſcience their faults proceeded not of error in ſaith, but of frailty in fleſh. That they acknowledge them, is one good ſtep to repentance; that they are ſory for them, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as good; that they haue faith, they profeſſe in wordes; that they die true Chriſtians, charitie willeth vs to preſume, and leaue the reſt to God. Behold therefore the cauſe why the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt penalty allotted heretikes (except a very few) in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, was baniſhment till the time of pope Pelagius that fate in the Pontificall ſea about the yeare of grace 557: who was the firſt that ordeined, they ſhould from thenceforth be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with death: and till that time, though moſt hereſies had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made their inrodes and inuaſions, yet among them were few heretikes condemned to death. And to ſay the truth, this maner of dealing of the primitiue Church well weighed, ſhall appeare founded on manifold reaſons and auctorities, which I let paſſe at this preſent. Now this diſcourſe importeth at leaſt; that ye ſhould not proceede ſo haſtily in ſuch purſuites as ye are wont, and yet will not I conclude that heretiks muſt be left vnpuniſhed. But contrariwiſe do affirme that the Magiſtrate ought with his ſword to ſmite the heretike duely conuinced. Howbeit my former caueat muſt alwaies be remembred, that the Magiſtrate is not to attempt any ſuch exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it may bring the Church &amp; Eſtate to confuſion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uok and ruine: in which occurrent our Sauiours doctrine is to be practized; that is, to leaue the darnell in the field till the day of harueſt, and not ſeeke to roote it out for feare of plucking vp or ſpoiling the good corne that growes among. And that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the hiſtories cited as well of th'Emperours Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, Galerius, Conſtantius, Conſtantine the great, Iouinian, Valentinian, Valens and others; as of Charles the fifth, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian, and Rodolph now reigning; conformably alſo to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2735:20"/>proceedings of the moſt part of our neighbors: agreeably more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to the matureſt and moſt deliberate Arreſtes of all our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne courts, geuen in the beginning of theſe ciuill warres; all which hiſtories I need not repeat. It were good that the Church and Magiſtrate agree to iudge and repreſſe heretikes, it is true: but it behoues the word of God to be receiued into their company and be preſident among them, as being chiefe of the three Crownes that are in the world, and to iudge according to the ſame, for ſomuch as to it onely belongeth to decide all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of religion: for ſith it is the ſeruice of God and his glory which in true religion is ſought, we muſt be directed by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and not by mans, where they be contrary. Moſt ſeemely it is that Iuſtice ſhould mainteyne the Church, that Moſes and Aaron ſhould be brethren: but yet Iuſtice muſt not vniuſtly fauour the Church,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</note> Moſes muſt not bluſh to rebuke his brother Aaron ſharply if he forſaketh Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to aſſiſt th'importunities of mens fanſies: it muſt not be, that through their mutuall ſupport euill counterpeized, the one of them ſhould ouerthrow the other, and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth with all: it is expedient, that Moſes and Aaron, <hi>viz.</hi> Iuſtice and the Church ſhould linke themſelues againſt heretikes in ſuch wiſe, that the Church incurre no daunger. For in caſe of euident perill men muſt attend the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hand of God:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 16.</note> as they did in behalfe of the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which fauoured the ſtrife about the Prieſthood. For had they vndiſcretly put hand to weapon, they ſhould haue greatly troubled and hazarded the whole body of the Church, they had buried many of the faithfull vnder the heapes of th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore they addreſſed their prayers to the Lord, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the cauſe to him. To be ſhort, our loue to the Church (as is ſaid afore) muſt excell our hatred to heretiks.
<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 11.</note> Euen ſo the Prophet Semeia forbad Roboam to make warre on the ten Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes of Iſrael that had reuolted with ſchiſme and hereſie from his gouernement, and from the doctrine and temple of the Lord: bycauſe this war, as may well be preſumed, would haue ſet the whole people of Iſrael in a moſt vehement flame &amp; confuſion. We read to this purpoſe, in th'Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, a narration
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2735:21"/>moſt worthy the marking, of Iuſtine th'Emperour ſyrnamed th'Elder. This Emperour hating heretiks, and ſpecially Arians, who at his comming to the Crowne were in great number and credit, made an Edict, whereby he forbad th'execiſe of th'Arian Religion: as ſoone as th'Arians were certified of this Edict, they went about to procure the like againſt the true Chriſtians, in places where they had greater power, &amp; got of Theodorik king of Italie, though a vaſſal and ſubiect of th'Empire, the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions throughout Italy for th'exerciſe of none beſide th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Religion: whereupon Pope Iohn the firſt of that name, who then was at Rome, ſeing himſelfe with all the faithfull not permitted th'vſe of their Religion, by th'aduiſe of all the good Biſhops &amp; Magiſtrates of Italy, aſſiſted with the Biſhop of Rauenna and certeine Senatours and Conſuls of Rome, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer to Conſtantinople with ſpeed to th'Emperour, to cauſe him to ceaſe his interdiction of th'Arian Religion, for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe no meanes in Italy was left to exerciſe the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: he ſhewed with teares and grones that better it were to let the heretikes line, then to put the true Church in ieoperdy, and to ſmoother it with new perſecutions. To be ſhort he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo, that th'Emperour reſtored th'Arians and left them in peace. Thus ye ſee the Pope himſelfe practiſe the doctrine I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. Haue ye not now a dayes as great reaſon and as great neede to ceaſe the purſuites and perſecutions that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reformed, &amp; to reſtore them the libertie of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and inioyment of their goodes, to th'end they may render to the Catholikes abiding in the countreis poſſeſſed by them, both their goods and th'exerciſe of their Religion, and agayne that they may aſſure all the townes and Catholike countries of Fraunce, where-into hap and force of armes may bring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and ſpecially to aſſure ſo many Catholikes dwelling in ſmall townes, boroughs and villages lockt in among their forts, whom they haue not hitherto diſquieted: for it is not to be doubted, but that in ſuch meaſure as they ſhall feele their owne diſcommodities, and diſpaire of reconcilement, their egrenes to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge wil encreaſe, albeit we muſt needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend hitherto their moderation therein. Beſides it appeareth that Conſtantine the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2735:21"/>great (whoſe actions are ordinarily, &amp; for the moſt part ſet forth as a rule to direct all Princes in their affaires) attributed ſo much to this doctrine as he might not poſſibly more. For to ſtop and preuent the tumultes &amp; commotions which the firſt &amp; ſmaller multitudes of Arians might haue made in th'eſtat &amp; Church, he did not onely ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reſt, in th'enioyment of their goods, in the libertie of their conſciences &amp; exerciſe of their Religion; but alſo the better to conteine them, to content and take from them all occaſion of running to armes, he ſhewed rigor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the faithfull at their inſtance. We read that to conteine and ſatisfie th'Arians he baniſhed that good man Athanaſius, moſt ſpitefully &amp; vniuſtly purſued by them: for they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by armes to ſeeke his death amid the embraſements, weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and defence of the faithfull: Conſtantine himſelfe, by his letters that he writ to the people of the Catholike Church of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, teſtifieth that for the conſideration aforeſayd, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Athanaſius. See here how good Emperours and good Magiſtrates haue cuer preferred the quiet of the Church, the peace of the people, before the rooting out of hereſies: aſſuring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that order, peace, &amp; the word of God can do more in ſuch matters then war with its confuſions &amp; outrages. And it is to be noted that when we enforced our ſelues to warre on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and heretikes with materiall armes, God for the moſt part withdrew his bleſſings from our workes and enterpriſes: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing haue we done, but waſt and confound the Church. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue oft attempted to chaſe the miſcreant Pagans out of the holy land; nothing haue they atchieued, but the ſharpning of th'Eaſt Churches perſecution, wherein they did ſo much that they are in a maner loſt. The Turke hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and encroched ſo far on Chriſtendome ſince we began to warre with him, that it paſſeth credit, conſidering we haue ſo oft, and with ſo great affection and power ſought againſt them. If God fauoured not our armies, when by vow &amp; vnfained deuotion thinking to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Paradiſe, thinking to aduance his kingdome, we employed our liues and goods to fight with the Turkes his enemies, and th'enemies of our faith, whom then we neede not feare ſeing the diſtance of their countrey from ours; and if it be permitted vs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2735:22"/>to conclude of the will &amp; bleſſing of God after the good or bad ſucceſſe of the warre, as ſometimes it falleth out: it may be ſaid, that if he bleſſed not ſuch armies, with great reaſon wil he curſe th'armies which we employ againſt them that demanded not as they ſay, but libertie to call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God by one onely Ieſus Chriſt, according to the contents of the holy Scripture, and vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct of the holy Ghoſt; which we employ againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, againſt our brethren and countreymen, who haue ought, or may haue goodes, eſtates and dignities, that would be very commodious for vs, and this laſt poinct makes our deuotion ſhrewdly ſuſpected. Againe, what haue we done in our ciuill warres that ſo many yeares haue ſet all the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Europe on fire, that haue whetted and armed all Chriſtians th'one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt th'other? We haue puld vp, ſo much as in vs lay; that ſmal deale of good corne which growes within the Lordes field; we haue made waſt both within and without, we haue cauſed inſinite ſoules to ſwarue, that otherwiſe were in a way good inough: we haue made ſo many hypocrites, ſo many diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers in the faith, and Atheiſtes, that I tremble and grudge to thinke of it: we haue ſo ruined both the ſtate and the Church that the deuill and the ſtranger ſinde breaches on all ſides to come trample and deſtroy vs vtterly. We are not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, God hath foretolde vs, that thinking to weede his field or Church, we ſhould pluck vp the good corne, we ſhould ſpoyle or roote out the faithfull. Th'experience of theſe eight and twentie or thirtie yeares paſt, hath made euident to vs, how much the narrow ſearch and purſuite made againſt the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, endangereth the Church and whole eſtate of this Realme. Let vs therefore leaue them in peace, that we alſo may be in peace; and let vs laud the Lord peaceablie and without ceaſing; let vs preſerue our ſelues with them, ſith we can not deſtroy them without deſtroying our ſelues. It is ſaid that the duety of the Magiſtrate, and of euery priuate perſon, but principally of the magiſtrate, is aboue all to tender the preſeruation of the ſtate. It is ſaid alſo, that the Magiſtrate is bound not to reſpect alone that which is iuſt and good ſimply, but withall diſcreetly to compare the iuſt with the iuſt, good with good, law with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2735:22"/>law, and the ſame wiſely to applie to preſent occaſions, ſtaying himſelfe on that which is better and more equall: to compare beſides th'uniuſt with th'uniuſt, euil with euill, and according to the neceſſitie of the time, and importance of the affaires, to ſtay himſelfe on that is leſſe vniuſt or euill. Now the iniuſtice is leſſe, to let the heretik, or the ſuſpected of hereſie liue in peace, than diſturbe the Church. There is more iuſtice and holines in the conſeruation of the Church, and of a whole eſtate to the comfort of a whole people, the maintenance of iuſtice and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in generall and particular, than in the diſſolution of the Church and of a Realme, and in th'annihilating and generall ſuppreſſion of Religion and iuſtice. For ſo much then as we are not able to order the Reformed after our will, or deſtroy them without putting the whole Chriſten Church, iuſtice, and all the people in hazard of an headlong downfal and vtter ſubuerſion, let vs accept, how late ſoeuer,

And albeit our power failes, or that we enterpriſe not to cut of heretikes: let vs not thinke therefore, that the glorie of God can be abaſed, or the Church rumed by by them: for the word of God ſhall vanquiſh &amp; conſume, how long ſoeuer it lingereth, the word and imagination of men, it can full wel worke what God willeth, as in Iſay is written:

In fine, let vs beware that raſh zele carrie vs not too farre, let vs reſtrayne and rule it after the doctrine and examples of the holy Scripture, and the imitation as well of the Primitiue Church, as of our neighbors. Away with theſe armes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, accurſed, and moſt pernicious to the Church, purge we the Church; ſeeke we the Churches repoſe by meanes allowed, bleſſed and commaunded of God, by the word of God, and the fruites thereof. Leaue we the Magiſtrates ſword, ſith it will not ſerue our turne without hazarding all, the Church, Magiſtrate and people. Let vs acknowledge then, that we haue failed, what zele ſoeuer we pretend: but much more, if our priuate &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſions, and not deuotion, haue prouoked vs to this warre. Whether it be ſo or no, ye know; ye may caſt a miſt before mens eyes, but not before the Lord; he created mens hartes, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if it be ſo that ye haue drawen ouer your faces the maske of deuotion to conceale the hatred, enuy, ambition &amp; the auarice that egs you on in deed to kindle theſe warres, ye may well be deemed the moſt execrable perſecutors that euer were. For the Heathen in their perſecutions againſt the faithfull were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2735:23"/>for the moſt parte caried on with deuotion they bare to their Gods. And therefore in the conſcience and true feeling of your great exceſſe, be the more diſpleaſed therewith. Shield not your fault with this blind excuſe, that the reformed haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armes for their defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which (ſay ye) the faithful neuer did; for in vſing that pretence ye auow them for faithfull and your ſelues perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: if they do amiſſe ye are th'originall; ye are anſwerable to God for their ſinnes &amp; your owne: ye force them to armes; for otherwiſe they ſhould be guilty of their own death, &amp; of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lord, if they being able would not ſeeke to auoid it. Iwis they arme not themſelues to build their Church by armes, but to defend their countries, townes, families, goods, repoſe, &amp; liues: they come not to aſſaile you with ſworde and fire, for to reſtraine you of your religion: they require nothing but peace and the preaching of Gods word for to build their Church: ye miſtruſt the truth and power of your religion, denying their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. Ouer and aboue, it is no new thing nor reproued to ſee the Church of God armed for its defence. The Iſraelites defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues againſt the Syrians, Aegyptians, Aſſyrians, Medes, and Perſians, th'almighty by ayding them hath ſhowen how well he allowed that their defence: he fought for them with hayle and thunder, hee ſtayed the courſe of the Sunne, that light might ſuffice them for th'vtter diſcomfiture of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he hath aſſiſted them with his Angels to confound their armies. We read alſo that God hath oftentimes fauoured the defence of Chriſtian churches, and ſpecially thoſe of th'Eaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of Conſtantine the great, againſt Licinius Emperour of the Eaſt, and by conſequence their Emperour and ſouerargne Magiſtrate, ſo farre forth that Licinius was put to flight: which is an hiſtory that locketh their lips, who boaſt ſo much of this maxime, that whole prouinces may not ſtand in defence of their religion againſt their Prince. For Licinius was lawfull Emperour of th'Eaſt without all controuerſie, euen when Conſtantine made warre on him to cauſe him to ſurceaſe his perſecutions againſt his Chriſtian ſubiects: and Conſtantine was not Emperour then but of Italie, Afrike, France, &amp; Spaine. Moreouer, moſt certaine it is that Licinius was Emperour of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2735:24"/>th'Eaſt long before Conſtantine was declared Emperour of the Weſt: neuertheleſſe he vndertooke this warre againſt Licinius at th'inſtance of th'Eaſt Churches, and was bleſſed of God. We read againe to this ſame purpoſe, how the Chriſtians of Perſia oppreſſed with intollerable afflictions by their king, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Romains crauing ſuccour of them, and praying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pitie their extreme neceſſity; the Biſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laboured ſo to Theodoſius th'Emperour that he vndertook their protection: Theodoſius made warre on the king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, obtayned many miraculous victories, and in fine compelled him to entreat his Chriſten ſubiects more gently. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pretend to haue at this day as good reaſon to appeale to the king of Nauarre, th'Almains and other their neighbors for protection and defence. And although hitherto ye haue ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted them in number of victories, yet that iuſtifieth your quarell neuer the more.

Iacob abode with the idolater Laban, ſerued him, maried his daughters: he viſited his brother Eſau reiected by God, he gratified him with offers and preſents, he called him his Lord. The Iſraelits dwelt and liued among th'Aegyptiens, Canaanits, Syrians, Aſſirians, Medes &amp; Perſians: they concluded leagues with the Greekes &amp; Romains: they I ſay, that were forbidden more expreſly then we, they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Synagogues in all regions: they were not able to withſtand the manifold changes in their Religion, euen within their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Citie, within the ſhadow of their temple: they were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with idolatries, hereſies, and ſchiſmes: they ſaw themſelues ſundred into many ſectes of Phariſies, Saduces and Eſſens.

Although th'enemy hath forced our tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches &amp; baricados, ſo that he is with vs pell mell, that he is come to cope hand to hand; we muſt not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2735:26"/>flie, we muſt determine on the combat, we muſt r'ally and ſtand ſtrong to the <hi>Corps du gard,</hi> hard by our chiefetaine, within the ſhadow of our colours.

Seing the Church is militant, it muſt not geue ground, but abide where th'enemie is. Who ſo flieth from his enemie, and hath withdrawen himſelfe ſo farre, that he can not ſmite, heare nor ſee him, may not be termed militant, or one that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth warre. We muſt keepe ſo cloſe to our enemies, that they ſee our fires, heare the ſound of our drummes and trumpets, that they ſee, heare and feele the glittering, the noyſe &amp; weight of our weapons. Euen ſo the Church milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to approach nigh the heretikes, namelie by charitie, that they heare and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſound of Gods worde, that they feele the vertue thereof to their confuſion, condemnation, or conuerſion. If we ſhould not draw nigh to infidels and heretikes after ſome ſort or other, God would not call ſo many as he doth daihe by the efficacie of his word, which he makes them vnderſtand publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by exhortations, ſermons and ſeruices; and priuatly by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtudies and conferences. Let vs not be afraide of them; the ſpirit of God is not a ſpirit of feare;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim</hi> 1.</note> the word of God is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier than all things; the primitiue Church required not to haue the Pagans baniſhed, but onely to be heard of them; the vertue of the Goſpel was not enfeebled by their ſpeaking, dealing and dwelling among them: otherwiſe, the combat is not appointed for the decay of the elect, but for their manifeſtation and glory, and for th'aduauncement of the ſpirituall kingdome. We haue a captaine that cannot be put to the worſe, if he lets the enemie approach, it is not to the hazard of being vanquiſhed and we with him; it is for to trie the valour of his ſoldiers, to diſcerne the faithfull from others. Let vs not doubt if we belong to him, he wil neuer loſe vs. Notwithſtanding, it is good for euery one to trie and ſound him ſelfe, and as he feeleth in his heart th'aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and motion of Gods ſpirit, ſo to go forwarde to the medley. If the Apoſtles, Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2735:27"/>had bene ſo delicate and tender as we would be, both Afrik and Europ had not yet bene waſhed from the ſteine of Arianiſme: we had neuer heard the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Goſpel, we ſhould not haue bene ſo nigh as we are, to th'accompliſhment of our Sauiours Prophecie,

Phiſitions do viſite the ſicke ſo ſhould they that are able, ſuccor perſons ſpiritually diſeaſed howbeit diſcreetly &amp; wiſely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of S.

Finally, let vs ponder, how Popes in this doctrine haue bene contrarie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which maketh vs doubt that ſometimes they applie their doctrines to their paſſions, and to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as ſoone as to the veritie. Councels, Popes, Emperours, Kings of Fraunce, and the greater part of other Kings &amp; Lords of Europe, haue permitted the Iewes to dwell in Cities of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, to erect them Sinagogues, and exerciſe their religion; there are of them moreouer at Rome where the Pope holdeth his See, they haue bene receiued and compriſed within Chriſten Common-wealths, they haue bene admitted to the power and part-taking of generall and particular policies, the Emperours by their lawes and ordinances approoued of the Pope, haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to publike charges, honors and dignities with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ouer them. Furthermore, Popes haue not only receiued into Chriſtendome the enemies of the Goſpel, but haue alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Chriſtians to ſeeke them, dwell and traffike with them, and for that ende to trauerſe all the compaſſe of the world, to aduenture al the dangers of th'earth the ſea, the aire, of men and of beaſtes. So the Portugals with th'allowance of Pope Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the ſixt, traffikt with the Affricans, the Sauadges and the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, built dwelling towers &amp; forts among them. Away then
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2735:27"/>with your opinion; it gainſayeth the letter and ſence of the holy Scripture, it gaineſtandeth the actions of our Lord, of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, Apoſtles, and of th'olde Church, it is contrary to the power of the Church, it is impoſſible to be performed in this world, it is contrarie to it ſelfe, and is condemned by their contrary actes that were th'auctors. Admit that it were beſt &amp; moſt profitable for the Church, if the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber were fulfilled, &amp; if it delayed not hir glory that ſhe were quite ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and heretikes: yet ſith this fulnes of contentment, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph is kept in ſtore for another world, we muſt acknowledge that where we are commaunded to ſeparate our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, it is chiefly meant of Eccleſiaſticall ſeparation, to th'end they may haue the mark of enemies, and not the ſeparation ciuile &amp; politik. Lo here againe, how the Lord inſtructeth vs, wherein to communicat with them, and wherein to deuide our ſelues from them. Loue (ſaith he) your enemies,
<note place="margin">

Then, as the Lord denies them not thinges common to all men, the ayre, th'earth, the light, and the water, but denyeth them his holy ſpirit, which he reſerueth for his choſen: ſo let vs not reiect thoſe their ſocieties that concerne but this world, and are neceſſary to all men as they are men, though not as the elect of God: ſpecially conſidering that we can not commodiouſly, and without putting the Church in perill of ruine, driue them wholy out from vs. God hath left them to the world, tarying for their conuerſion: let vs leaue them by the Church, tarying for their repentance, and Gods grace to bring them in.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2735:28"/>be it that we muſt liue nigh heretikes and infidels, ſeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may not be, and that it ſeemeth neceſſarie for th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the kingdome of Chriſt, yet muſt we trauaile, as Saint Paul appointeth, and do the worke of Euangeliſts, to let them from plucking downe the building of the Church, yea to let them from building in the houſe of God, if it were poſſible. Perhaps it is tolerable to liue with them vnder one politike gouernement, prouided that we haue at the leaſt equall power with them: but it is intolerable to be commaunded by them, by cauſe that ſeemeth preiudiciall to th'aduancement of the ſoueraigne auctoritie of Gods word. For the moſt part of men conforme themſelues to the man<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

By common obſeruation, all peoples require in their Emperours, Kings &amp; gouernours, not to vary fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Th'Ægyptians approued not their king, till he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and aſſented to the Religion of their Prieſtes: likewiſe the Perſians, Indians and euery nation welnigh. Ye alledge ſurther, that the bond of Religion betweene kings and their ſubiects, being rent in ſunder and taken away, there is nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, there is no more will and conſent, it is nought els ſaue force and tyranny: that Religion aboue all things doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and conteine ſubiects in obedience, as appeareth by moſt Empires, Monarchies, and common wealthes, begun, enlarged and mainteined rather by Religion then by iuſtice and armes, that in conſideration hereof kings ſubmitted them ſelues to the heads and Princes of their Religion, or els were intitled them ſelues, Princes of Prieſts and Sacrificers. So did the Spartan and Romain kings call themſelues ſoueraigne ſacrificers. Mahumet &amp; his ſucceſſors the Caliphes &amp; Sultans, the Sophies of Perſia, the kings of Calicut, and of AEthiopia called themſelues ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne rulers of their Religió in all lands vnder their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: the Othomans alſo deferre the ſame honour wholy to their <hi>Muphtis</hi> th'examples of our Chriſtians, &amp; among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall preſidents to this purpoſe come faſt inough into your memory. Whereupon yee concluded that ſith it pleaſeth not God to fauour your king and you alſo with a ſucceſſor deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his loynes, &amp; for that yee ſee the next heires to whom
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2735:28"/>by order of ſucceſſion the Crowne doth apperteine, according to your lawes and cuſtomes, not to be of like Religion to yours, ye therefore by good right do prouide in good time not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their dominion, to th'end ye forgoe not your Religion. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all theſe conſiderations haue ſome waight, but yet they muſt yeeld to cauſes of more weight, they muſt geue place to truth. I auow that the will of ſubiectes towardes their Princes, &amp; Princes power ouer their ſubiects, whereof proceede the hope of commoditie, fauour, honour and dignitie, and the feare of their contraries, do aſtoniſh men, and make them ſtark blind, and do imperiouſly commaund their conſciences: I wot well that moſt men follow rather the Religion of fortune, then that of God: we know it too well. But with the faithfull it hath no place, to whom nothing is more deare then the Church of God, who confeſſe with S.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4.5.</note> Peter that they ought to heare and obey rather God then men: who know it to be requiſite, that by ſuch viſitations the choſen ſhould be confirmed and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, as alſo the Church rid and disburdened of men that are in it, but not of it. You ſtay beſides vpon obſeruations of Heathen people eſtranged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, iwis it is not there that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt ſeeke &amp; ſixe his eye, to finde out and take view of his <hi>Vrſaminor,</hi> his Pole ſtarre, to direct, guide, &amp; aſſure his courſe according to the ſame, it is againſt his dutie to order his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; actions publik or priuat by their lawes or cuſtomes: there is light enough in the houſe of God to illuminate and lead vs; out of the ſame houſe we ſhould not ſeeke light: all ſulnes of truth &amp; knowledge is in the holy Scripture; the ſpring of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the fountaine of ſapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; the floud of ſcience iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue fro the ſame, which not withſtanding are as vanities to vaine mindes, and full of fruict to ſoules full of grace. The likehhood is great in that where as religions haue bene ſo mightie among Infidels, haue mounted aloft, and bin ſeated on the Thrones of kings, ruling ouer them with ſo much pompe, auctoritie and credit; that it was an enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r &amp; ſorcery that Satan wrought and worketh yet, to continue and renew the firſt maladie &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Gentiles and miſcreants. He knoweth that true Chriſten religion ſhould come and abide in all pouertie, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2735:29"/>lowlineſſe, and obedience: he filled the hearts of men with vanitie, he put into their heads and perſuaded them, how the greatnes and aſſurance of mightie ſtates depended on religion, how the bliſſe and felicitie of this worlde are children or vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideable companions of religion, he inured them to a religion of gold, of ſiluer, and veluet, to make them more hard to be woon by the Goſpell. At this haue the Iewes, and ſo many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions byſide, taken offence, it irked them greatly, to reſigne the commaundements, powers and riches, the glory, eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of this world, to make profeſſion of ſubiection and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other miſery preached and promiſed by Ieſus Chriſt to his folowers, againſt their expectation. Ye ſuppoſe then, that the eſtates, fauours and commodities of this world agree with true religion, that they fauour and exalt it, that without them it can not be planted, it can not encreaſe and ſtand: on this opinion your doubt and the motiues thereof be grounded. Beleeue me this opinion ſpringeth from Satan. For the Church of God hath its roote in heauen, there it takes beginning, thence it getteth grouth, perfection and euerlaſtingnes. Satan, worldly men and the fleſh are enemies of the ſame. It is a marke of falſe, and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall religion, when this world with the vanities, luſts, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights therof, when ſcepters, &amp; crownes, &amp; their pompe do kiſſe and embrace it, making it their foundation and main-ſtay. So began Zoroaſtres th'Empire of the Bactrians &amp; Perſians by the ſuppoſed religion of Horoſmadis: Triſmegiſtus that of th'Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, by the religion of Mercurie: Zamolſis of the Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by that of Veſta: Charondas of the Calcidians by that of Saturne: Allinos of the Cretians, by that of Iupiter: Numa by the fained and imagined ſuperſtition of Nimph Egeria, ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned th'infancie of the Romaine Empire, which ſtaggered, and had quite fallen at the riſing thereof, but that he aſſured &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it; he prepared the ſtorehouſe of their willes &amp; forces, which furniſhed all thoſe warres that aduanced the Empyre to the loftieſt degree of highneſſe. Th'abominable religion of Mahumet founded, exalted, and eſtabliſhed the great Turkiſh and Perſian empires. The religion of Changuis, and fond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to his dreames began the greatnes of th'Empire of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2735:29"/>To be ſhort the world and falſe religion agree too well, they lend one another the ſhoulder; but it fareth not ſo with the Church of God. By this ye know, that ye are my Diſciples,

And therefore true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion neuer raiſed any Empire, and Gods will was not that ſhe ſhould ſway any ſcepter of the mighty monarchies of Aſſyria, Media, Perſia, Greece or Italy: contrariwiſe the Church hath almoſt cuer bene tributary, or capture, or in warre, bene driuen to borow hir harbour and liuing as a ſtranger on earth,

So was Abraham poſted from Aſſyria to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia, from Meſopotamia to Canaan, from Canaan to Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, from Aegypt to Canaan. The people of Iſrael were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in hard thraldome by th'Egyptians, worne and welnigh conſumed by the wildernes, fought with by nations, fubdued by th'Aſſyrians, kept out of their country by the Medes, ſent home by the Perſians; they hyred their freedome of the Greekes, were maiſtred and finally ſcattred of the Romaines. The Chriſtian Church began in an Eſtate moſt defaced then of al the world, in Iury, vnder the tyrannie of Prieſts and their partakers, vnder the tyranny of Kings of that countrie, of Deputie-Conſuls &amp; Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants

Learne we therefore in no wiſe to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the cauſe of temporall gouernments with the cauſe of the Church; learne we that true religion ſoloweth not fortune, nor ſcepters, ne leaneth on them; but contrarily, that ſcepters ſhun and reiect it: that ſhe takes not her encreaſe of them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe is proyned by them: that God knowes well to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine and augment her, as he iudgeth expedient, all croſſing &amp; gain-ſtriſe of worldly powers notwithſtanding. I wil not ſay, that the crownes of this world and religion meete not; God
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2735:30"/>permitteth it ſometime for to refreſh his people afflicted, and with fighting againſt their miſeries tired: and to ſhew that he is wel able, if he will, to geue them the contentments of this world: but by and by (remembring the frailtie of the fleſh, apt to corrupt, if it be not exerciſed) he ſundereth them. to certifie her alſo, that ſhe lay hold on contentation elſwhere than here below: the hiſtories of the Bible are our leſſons for all theſe things.

It is not then for their religions ſake that we muſt obey them, it is for our religions ſake, it is for our conſcience ſake, it is for Gods ſake, who hath commaunded it. The holy Scripture affoordeth vs examples ſo expreſſe of th'obedience of the Church to all kings and Gouernors, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, perſecutors, tyrants, and others, that it may ſeeme the holy Ghoſt regiſtred them expreſly to reſolue vs in this difficultie. The Iſraelites Gods people were inioined by the Lord to auoid all ſocieties and alliances with infidels and Idolaters; they had no commandement as had the Chriſtians, to communicate their religion to all nations; alſo they ought to haue bene, and ſo were, of all people moſt ielous of the puritie of their religion, and preſeruation thereof: neuertheleſſe, when their kings and ſucceſſors forſooke the way of God, for to ſacrifice in the lugh places, betaking themſelues to idol-worſhip, and ſeruing of ſtrange Gods, they ſtouped vnder the mightichand of God, and receiued ſuch kings as God would graunt them, and therefore they neuer went about to expel their kings, nor made exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:2735:31"/>or reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their ſucceſſors for religions ſake: they endured the gouernment of Ieroboam, Achab, Ioram, Ochoſias, Achas, Manaſſes, Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; many mo endued with nothing but vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. They impeached not the ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that moſt wicked &amp; idolatrous Iora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the very deuout &amp; meek Ioſaphat. So ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ochoſias to Ioram, Achas to Ioatham, Manaſſes to Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kias, Amon to Manaſſes, and Ioacham to Ioſias. Now we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are much more bound to th'obedience of all Magiſtrates either faithfull or misbeleeuers. For our true profeſſion is of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, ſubiection and obedience, as th' Apoſtles in many places aboue cited and directed to vs, haue preſcribed. But beſides that, hath Ieſus Chriſt by his commaundements and actions ſtopped our mouth, and ouerthrowen whatſoeuer may be proponed to excuſe you or maintaine your opinion. He being God,

Are we greater and more honorable then Ieſus Chriſt, that we ſhould peruert th'order of ſucceſſions, the lawes &amp; eſtate of the Realme to chuſe vs as a king? Ieſus enquired not, he ſtood not vpon the Emperours religion and other qualities; he is God, we be men, we be what him pleaſeth we be, we haue no being, nor qualitie belonging, but by him: he might by right haue excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, after the lawes of the world, of paying tribute, as himſelfe ſaith, howbeit to th'end he ſhould not offend the maieſtie of kings, he payed it: but we not onely offend our Princes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo rather than acknowledge them, we will ſeeke the ouerthrow of th'eſtate and any part thereof. The Apoſtles acknowledged kings, Lieutenants, and Magiſtrates, though inſidels, &amp; rendred them obedience: S. Paul ſubmitted himſelfe to the gouernment and iuriſdiction of the Emperours of Italie, and their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, he ſought out their priuiledges, allowed their lawes and vſed them for his aid, he appeared before them and vnder-went their iuriſdiction, and according to the order of the ſame yeelded himſelfe at the Emperours feet, whither to he had appealed. And ſithence then, haue Chriſten Churches continued their dutie of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2735:32"/>obedience to Princes of the Countries they were in, being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and their perſecutors. We are bound not onely to obay, but furthermore to pray for them,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> thus S. Paul commaundeth; I warne that afore all things, requeſts, prayers, ſupplications, &amp; thank eſgiuing be made for all men, for kings, and all them that are ſet in auctoritie: to wit; though they be Idolaters, though they perſecute and impriſon vs, as hath bene ſaid. So the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael hauing bene vanquiſhed, ſpoiled and led into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie in the citie of Babylon, the ſeat of all Idolatrie, ſee how God commaundeth them by his prophet leremie:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iorem.</hi> 29.</note> craue for the peace of the citie into which I haue cauſed you to be tranſlated, and pray to the Lord for it. Nay moreouer the Lord takes part againſt them that diſobey their ſuperiours; he deemeth it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie done to himſelfe, for good reaſon it is, ſith he ſent them, that he ſhould conceiue diſpleaſure at the diſobedience ſhowen them: and therefore he threatneth the diſobedient: they ſhall procure themſelues damnation, ſaith S. Paul. Admit though the kings were not our naturall and lawfull kings but by vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, by violence, by title of conqueſt alone, yet he threatneth, and pardoneth not if we diſobey them. Euen ſo the Lord by way of reproch ſaith to his people by the prophet Baruch:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar.</hi> 2.</note> Bow your ſhoulder, and your necke, and ſerue the king of Babilon, and you ſhalbe ſeated in the land, which I gaue vnto your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but if ye do it not, &amp; if ye hearken not to the voice of the Lord your God, to ſerue the king of Babylon, I will bring to paſſe that ye ſhall no more be in the cities of Iuda, nor come out of the citie of leruſalem, I will take from you the voice of mirth, the voice of ioy, the voice of the bridegrome, the voice of the ſpouſe, &amp; all the land ſhalbe without any ſigne, &amp; they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the ſame. Behold how he witneſſeth his will, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple obey the idolatrous king Nabuchodonoſor, and threatneth fearefull penalties, if they obey him not. But threats alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed him not: it fortuned his people to reuolt againſt Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonoſor, he made them feele th'effect of all his threatnings and curſes; Ieruſalem becauſe of this reuolt was taken by force and ſacked,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 25.</note> moſt of the Iſraelites put to the ſword; the reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained like captiues were led to Babilon, where they endured
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2735:32"/>a very long time intollerable ſlauery; their king Sedekias was taken, his eyes pluckt out, and after ended his daies in moſt vile bondage. Finally, one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration among the reſt ſhould make all Chriſtians abhorre the diſturbers of Eſtates vpon earth, and ſuch as riſe againſt their Princes to impeach their auctoritie or force them to ſlie, and ſhould warne them carefully to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they forte not themſelues with ſuch. That is,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Iud.</hi> 1.</note> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles haue left written in many places, that to riſe againſt powers, to conſound, trouble, and go about to diſpoſe them, is a token of Antichriſt. Aduiſe your ſelues (my children) how ye may remoue from your Church the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition hereof. Let vs not ſay, it is the Reſormed that trouble our ſtate, that diſobey the king, his Lieutenants and Magiſtrates, becauſe they will not go to the Maſſe, and make their profeſſion. For it is none of that, wherein God willeth vs to obey earthly powers. He imparteth kings this honour, to take them for his Lieutenants in gouernment of the world, but not in all gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hath reſerued to himſelfe one parte, which he will not haue them meddle with, namely the gouernance of the higheſt parte of the ſoule, of the conſcience, and religion: he hath giuen herevpon his lawes and commaundements, which he willeth to be preferred afore the commaundements of men, he liketh not that men ſhould enterpriſe ought ouer them: he is aboue the kings of th'earth, he is their Creator, it is good reaſon that his commaundements ſhould ouer-rule theirs. For ſo S. Peter, and S. Iohn, being in all things elſe moſt obedient to Magiſtrats, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them that forbad them to preach the Goſpell:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4.5.</note> Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you rather then God, iudge ye; and againe, we ought rather to obey God, then men. We haue ſhewed afore, that th'Iſraelits were puniſhed for ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring themſelues out of the dominion of Nabuchodonoſor, for hauing diſobeyed him: neuertheles it is recorded how Ananias, Aſarias &amp; Miſael th'Iſraelits were bleſſed of God, &amp; protected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raging violence of the deuouring fire, &amp; glorified for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying Nabuchodonoſor. Theſe diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cannot be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but by the foreſaid diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that kings muſt be obeyed in that which concerneth their power alone, without doing iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2735:33"/>to God, who requireth our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce principally &amp; aboue all, according as the aunſweres of S. Peter and S. Iohn aboue cited do import: no other doctrine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our Sauiour Chriſt taught in theſe wordes;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.</note> Geue vnto Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and to God that which is Gods. When the people of Iſrael reuolted, Nabuchodonoſor had not vſurped ouer Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements nor bound th'Iſraelites but to an ordinarie allegeance of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects towards their kings for ſeruice of body and goodes, and therefore their diſobedience was an inexcuſable ſin: but he abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and exceeded the limites of his right and power, by cauſe he would haue made the three children worſhip his Idoll, and ſo preſumed ouer Gods commaundement; thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue, and therefore the diſobedience of Ananias, Aſarias and Miſael was iuſt: and with ſuch diſobediences the ſacred hiſtory is well ſtored. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Reformed do pretend, that what you commaund them, is contrary to the word and commaundements of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they proteſt, that their conſcience ſaued, they are ready to yeld all obedience and ſeruice to their ſuperiours and namely to his Maieſtie: we ſhall examine that matter anone. Meane while let vs determine vpon ſo many reaſons and examples, vpon th'actions and commaundements of our Lord, of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and all his Church. Let vs affirme that the true Church preſumeth not to take away, nor geue the Crownes and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world, but ſubmitteth hir ſelf to th'order eſtabliſhed in that behalf from all time, by the will of God. Let vs beleeue that kings are ordained by God, that he will not haue any and namely his Church to refuſe them, or their ſucceſſours for any impietie in them: that he will haue ſuch executions reſerued to himſelf, which he can well bring to paſſe by other meanes and pretences then by his Church: Let vs confeſſe his will to be that we loue and honour them, and alſo pray for them, that he threateneth and plagueth ſuch, as trouble and diſobey them. Ye that are Chriſtians then, and boaſt to be his children, whoſe dutie therfore is to heare and know his voyce, and to ſerue him with more obedience then all other people; yee that ought to belecue that whatſoeuer yee do or ſuffer in obeying him, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2735:33"/>ſame can not turne to your harme or preiudice, conſidering his bountifull affection, his promiſes and almightines: do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to diſobey your God in a matter ſo expreſly inioyned you; if ye haue preſumed, repent your ſelues, ceaſe your purſuit, preferre not your falſe opinions, and vayne feares afore his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, afore the truth and aſſurance of his promiſes: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Kings and Princes that he ſends you; ſince he created them to be of his degree, the likewiſe ſent them; receiue them for his loue and feare; for conſcience ſake: and ſo will he auow you for his children, and betake you to the guiding of his good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo ſhall he bleſſe, and geue you the peace ſpoken of by Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; and laſtly, ſo ſhall ye not incurre his diſpleaſure,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 29.</note> nor feele the weight of his prouoked hand. The ſame reaſon, or one more ſtrong then yours, did Sedekias alleage: he ſaid, he would not ſubiect himſelfe to an idolatrous king: ye ſay, ye will not receiue a king of a Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contrary to yours. Good it is to auoyd ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo much as may be: but they muſt be auoided by meanes alowed of God. God ſounde no ſuch zele, affection and deedes in Sedekias to be good; he accurſed it, he greeuouſly did puniſh it: he will nothing more alow yours, being farre leſſe tolerable, as by this diſcourſe hereafter ſhalbe verified: nay, I greatly feare, leaſt the plague be at the dore. On th' other ſide, conſider that ye open a gate to the continuance of warres, which ye ſhall not ſhut &amp; dain vp when ye would, ye reare a ladder for clymbing heads, &amp; all ſuch as will attempt the catching of your Crowne, which ye ſhall not pluck downe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye would: they that ſhall enuie at the Crowne will think themſelues well enough armed with excuſe and pretence, not to bluſh in your preſence nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrangers, as alſo preſerue their honor, &amp; ſaue their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decay before the poſterity, if onely they ſhall ſay that the king, or the naturall &amp; lawfull ſucceſſour to the Crowne is an heretike. Your predeceſſours made the Crowne inheritable by ſucceſſion, purpoſely to preuent diſſenſions that grow by elections, and in th'end bring Eſtates to confuſion: they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of their hope &amp; we of the profit of their foreſights, by your tractablenes and indiſcretion: for this colored pretence which you accept now a dayes, will draw after it all thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2735:34"/>and inconueniences which elections are wont to bring. But for concluſion, what need had ye to begin this warre ſo ſoone? ſuppoſe it were lawfull; yet were the time rath enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, reuiue and debate this queſtion after our kings deceaſe. The courſe is not ordinarie to diſpute of ſucceſſions before they fall. It may appeare that ye repine at the repoſe of your king, &amp; feare leaſt he ſhould be free from the greeues, which we ſee &amp; feele at this day. Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ye rayſe warre for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which neuer ſhall come to paſſe. Our King and Queene are ſtrong and luſtie enough to haue heires of their body begotten, they are not paſt th'age of procreation; th'arme of the Lord and his mercy are not ſhortned &amp; reſtreined to geue a ſonne to him, and a peaceable king to vs: it may fall out that yee, or your Princes will change your purpoſes.</p>

Thus is vnderſtanding ſled away, ignorance and vice come in place, hauing regained the dominion ouer vs. Behold againe, how it is no ſtraunge thing that the Pope hath reigned ſo long; ſith An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ought to begin ſhortly after the firſt comming of our Lord, and endure long, till a time and many times, and halfe a time,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note> as Daniel ſaith.</p>
               <p>It is written, that Antichriſt the ſonne of perdition ſhall liſt himſelfe aboue all that which is called God, or is worſhipped, ſo farre as to ſit in the temple of God, as God; ſhewing himſelfe that he is God. The Pope doth name himſelfe God in earth onely, but in effect doth behaue himſelfe as God ouer all: he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, altereth; and repealeth lawes; he geueth priuileges, goods,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2735:36"/>eſtats, fauours, he geueth good ſeaſons and bad, by his power; by his bleſſings &amp; curſings he threateneth kings, puniſheth, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth, chaungeth, and ſupplanteth them; and (that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to God the king of kings) he wil be adored on earth: &amp; ſo is he God in earth. He ſaith, he hath power ouer the deuill, he can take ſoules out of hell, out of the company and dominion of the deuill, which can not apperteine but to Ieſus Chriſt: and ſo is he God in hell. He aſſureth vs, that he can ſend ſoules into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, whatſoeuer infidelitie is in them, whatſoeuer ſinne they committed in this world, by his great Iubiles, by certeine bead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rols of prayers and ceremonies, by money; &amp; therefore nameth himſelfe ghoſtly Father of ſoules. It is God that is our father, who by his grace, exceeding bountie and mercy, hath called &amp; choſen vs to be in his Paradiſe, it is our Lord Ieſus, who by the great loue he beareth vs, by his death and paſſion, hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs, opened vs the gate, guideth and bringeth vs thither, through the faith we haue in him and which he geueth vs by his holy ſpirite. Thus the Pope is God in Paradiſe, is God ouer all. He ſitteth in the Temple of God as we haue ſaid, for that he ruleth ouer all Chriſtendome being the Temple of God. He aduaunceth himſelfe aboue all that is called God, aboue Iudges and Magiſtrats which are called Gods in Scripture: they can not be Iudges without vndertaking his mark, allowing &amp; well teſtifying of it, and without ſwearing fealtie to him: lawes and Iudgements depend on him. Kings and Emperours are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Gods in Scripture: yet he exalteth himſelfe aboue them; the maner is to kiſſe the Kings hand, th'Emperours knee, and the Popes foote: he crowneth and bleſſeth them; he maks them promiſe and ſweare fealtie, that they will yeld him all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, obedience and ſeruice. Lewes of Bauaria th'Emperour was excommunicated for hauing taken on him the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of th'Empire, before he had performed th'othe of ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or as ſome hiſtory writers ſay, for not hauing auowed the Pope for ſoueraigne Iudge of the variance touching th'Empire betweene him and Frederik of Auſtrich: Frederik the ſecond was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, for preſuming to iourney into Aſia with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking leaue of the Pope. And to knit vp all in a word, there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2735:37"/>are no Kings nor Emperours but by him for he deliuereth their Realmes in pray at his pleaſure, he depriueth and reſtoreth them their ſubiects at his luſt. He exalts him ſelfe aboue Angels, he commaunds them peremptorily. He exalts him ſelfe aboue th'Apoſtles and other Saincts in Paradiſe; at his bidding they muſt runne, trot and ſollicite euen as he will, as though their Saincting, honour and ſaluation depended on him. He rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, gloſeth, interpreteth, chaungeth, choppeth and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the word of God, as beſt fitteth his fanſie; he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the law, he diſguiſeth, correcteth, enlargeth and deſpenceth againſt the lawes and commaundements of God: God muſt not be obeyed, but as pleaſeth the Pope. He aboliſheth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; the merite of our Lords death and paſſion he aſcribeth to the workes of men, and to the obedience they beare him and his fooliſh inuentions and ceremonies. Th'election of the faithfull belongeth to God no more, the Pope hath vſurped and limited the ſame. He Saincteth whom he pleaſe; he hath arrogated to himſelfe the office of ſanctifier aboue the holy Ghoſt. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth or thinks to make the like ſtirres and alterations in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as he doeth here below; he carieth at his girdle the ſeuen keyes and ſeuen ſeales of the ſeuen Churches; ſaying, it is his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſice to ſhut and open the Churches. Lo, how he lifteth vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all that is called God. Thus the markes which (as S. Paule teacheth) ſhould be in Antichriſt,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 8.</note> are found in the Pope. See here alſo the Propheſie of Eſdras veriſied, that the miſeries of the laſt times ſhould happen by occaſion of great pride.</p>
               <p>It is written in Daniel,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</note> that Antichriſt ſhall thinke he may change times &amp; lawes. Who ſo heedfully marketh the doctrine, policie, and ſeruice of the Romane Church, ſhall not find there any conſormitie or agreablenes with the Goſpel, but contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie almoſt throughout all: the Goſpell ſpeaketh neither of Maſſe, Purgatorie, calling vpon Saincts, nor of Prayers for the dead, Images, or Holy water, nor of wax tapers, or proceſſions, pilgrimages, nor of Munkeries, of the Altar, or Prieſtly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; the word, baptiſme, &amp; holy ſupper are not adminiſtred in the Romane Church according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, ordman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; vſage of our Lord, of his Apoſtles &amp; Primitine Church.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2735:37"/>The Goſpell preacheth nothing but grace and free-guift; the Pope commaundeth nothing but merite, and monie. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell requireth not of men but faith to receiue ſaluation, &amp; good workes to giue witnes of their election, iuſtification, new-birth, fanctification, and loue towardes God: the Pope knowes not what this Faith means, it brings him no aduantage; he therefore ſpeakes but of workes. The Goſpell preacheth not but the worde, and commaundeth not but the commaundements of God; &amp; forbiddeth the Traditions of men by name: the Pope commandeth not but the Traditions of men, nay he conceleth, yea ſometimes forbiddeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God. It is not much aboue threeſcore yeares ago that in the Church of God, there was no talke of God; in the Churches of Chriſt, no talke was of Chriſt: to the flock of Ieſus Chriſt, the voice of the Lord, of their great Shepheard was not declared, nor read, nor heard, nor vnderſtood; the Biſhops and Doctors that gaue themſelues to ſtudie, muſed on nothing elſe ſaue prophane learning and philoſophie, on vanities, fained inuentions, phantaſies and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the fleſh: all prayers, diuine-worſhips, maſſes and Church-ſeruices were made to the dead, and them alone who were in the Popes good grace, but in chiefe to thoſe that had in their life time moſt trauailed to extoll &amp; aduance his ſacred See by violences, lies, fables, falſe miracles &amp; other deceiptfull trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries. The Apoſtles baptiſed with pure water in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: the Pope hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled therewith his creame, ſalt, ſpittle, and ſo many idle ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies beſides, that the Baptiſme of the Apoſtles may ſeeme welnigh loſt. The holy Supper likewiſe is ſo diſguiſed, that the ſimple Goſpeller can diſcerne therein nothing that comes of God. The Pope alſo hath altered the yeares, moneths, &amp; daies, applying the hiſtories of the Goſpell to th'obſeruations of Aſtronomers, and motions of the Moone and Sunne. Behold how the Pope hath gone about to change times and lawes, both that of Moſes and this of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, euen the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and th'accompliſhment thereof; wherein th'vnderſtanding of the Propheſie doth chiefly conſiſt.</p>

He tooke it from the Germaines, to geue it the French; and after from the French, to geue it the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes: a very long time hath he made faire ſhew to theſe two Nations, croſſing or fauouring the hopes now of th'one &amp; then of the other: he let it be taken from Conradin; he oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt Maufred, &amp; made war on him, calling this war ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which touched th'eſtate of Religion in nothing, but only the eaſe, ſecuritie, profite, enuie and grudge of his holineſſe: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thither the Earle of Aniou, he condemned and put to death Conradm by the hand of the hangman, and a douzen or fiftene
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2735:39"/>great Lords with him, for no other cauſe than his owne priuate hatred: after that, he fauoured the Earle of Aniou againſt the houſe of Arragon a great while, but at laſt in fauor of the houſe of Arragon, he tooke from Charles of Aniou and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors that which he had geuen them. Briefly, there hath bene no quarrell nor iar betwene the Lords of Chriſtendome, which hath not bene kindled by him, wherof he hath not taken intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, &amp; wherein he hath not demaunded the obedience of both parties. He hath ſtirred vp the French againſt the Greeks and Lombards, the Germaine againſt the French, the French a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Germaine, the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Germain, the French againſt the Italian the Italian againſt the French, and againe the Spaniard againſt the French, all Chriſten dome againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, the French againſt th'Arrogomans, the Spaniard againſt the Nauarreans. He hatched the diuiſion of th'Vrſins and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnas, of the Guelfs and Ghibelins, &amp; the warre betwixt the Genoans and Venetians. It is impoſſible to diſcourſe of al theſe in particular, I cannot abide to ſtand vpon them, their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is ſo grieuous. In like maner the diuiſions that Popes haue made in the Church, the ſchiſmes of two or three Popes at once, the ſects of Monkes, Friers and Nunnes require ſo long a proceſſe, that I may not vndertake to recite them at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But what is ſaid ſufficeth to ſhew that the Pope deſpiſeth gouernments and maketh diuiſions.</p>
               <p>It is written, that Antichriſt ſhalbe an aduerſarie;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> the true ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this word Antichriſt is as much to ſay, as againſt or contrary to Chriſt: now let vs compare the leaſt actions &amp; doctrine of Popes, to that of Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ye will iudge that nothing is more contrary.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour had no place where he might reſt his head:

               <p>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt refuſed to iudge and deuide an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance betweene two brethren,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12.</note> and whereas one of them praied him to do it, he ſent him away ſaying; who hath made me a iudge or a diuider ouer you? The Pope hath vſurped ſecular iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of all thinges among all perſons, without ſpeaking
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2735:40"/>of the ſpirituall, whereof he maketh none partakers. In ſo much that in the reigne of Philip Valois, the court of Parlement and other iudges royall were enforced to complayne to the King. They declared to him how all the iuriſdiction belonging to the Iudges Royall flowed away from the kings Benches to th'Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical courts; and that farre mo profane or ciuil cauſes were iudged by Biſhops, their Officials and other Officers of the Church, then by the kings Iudges; that he which for the leaſt occaſion would not obey and abide the cenſures and ſentences of the Eccleſiaſticall, ſhould forthwith be excommunicated &amp; depriued of the Sacraments; and that there power and auctority was come to this paſſe, that for a ſimple debt a man vnable to pay was interdicted: that they had vſurped, the impriſoning &amp; deteyning of all malefactors, with the notice &amp; triall of their crimes. Poore de Cugneres was diffamed for hauing too truly pleaded on this declaration. And yet at this day ye retaine the proceedings which ye call the Chicanerie of the Popes court; he did you that good while he aboad at Auimon. Ye iudge the moſt part of your proceſſes by the Popes ordinances. There is no company of iudges where the Pope hath not brought in his Lieutenants: the courtes where your goods, your life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are iudged euen the courts of Parlement do partly conſiſt of perſons Eccleſiaſticall, Chanons, Abbats, Biſhops, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops: the great and goodlier proceſſes, th'affaires of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reuenues, Eſchequer and Eſtate are iudged and determined by them in the great counſell, in the priuie counſell, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Finances, in the counſell of Eſtate, and in the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete counſell: they are Peeres and ſoueraigne Iudges of this Realme, &amp; are Princes therein. Th'imperiall dignitie is adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged &amp; giuen by the Popes after the iudgement &amp; electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Archbiſhops, which alſo iudge all the affaires of the Empyre.

               <p>Ieſus Chriſt fled, doubting leaſt the people would make him king: the Pope peſtreth the ayre and hell with bruites, and the earth with courſings vp and downe, to atteyne the ſoueraigne throne and be ouer kings; and to this end ſeekes out and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth men and deuils; gold, ſiluer and iron; hypocriſie and lies; poyſon and force.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt hued in all obedience, ſubmitted himſelfe to Gouernours, Kings and Emperours, payde them tribute; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to be iudged by them: th'Apoſtles likewiſe haue bowed vnder their commaundements and iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The Popes liue in all power, &amp; not onely diſobey, but alſo vniuſtly commaund Kings and Emperours, iudging them as we haue ſaid, and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tribut from them and their ſubiectes: and Boniface the eight by name made a Decree againſt all Chriſten Kings and Princes excommunicating them for euer, that ſhould leuie any exactions vpon Clergie-men.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles: yee know that they which rule ouer the people haue dominion ouer them, &amp; their Princes haue auctoritie ouer them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you, but whoſoeuer among you will be the greateſt ſhal be your ſeruant, and whoſoeuer wil be the firſt among you ſhal be ſeruant to al. For ſo the ſonne of man is not come to be ſerued, but to ſerue, and giue his life for the redeeming of many. The Pope ruleth both ouer people and Princes, and alſo ouer all Biſhops which clayme to be likewiſe th'Apoſtles ſucceſſours. Neuertheleſſe he nameth himſelfe ſeruant of the ſeruants of God, he thinketh that God is without iudgement as are his Idols, he makes a mockerie of God, he takes the name, and doth the contrary to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2735:41"/>that it ſignifieth: ſince that men feele themſelues more highly diſpleaſed with offences done them by doltiſh driftes then by open diſobedience; how ſhould God concerue thinke ye, and be moued at this blaſphemie ſo groſe, to call himſelfe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſeruants, and neuertheleſſe to play the tyrant ouer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, people, Kings, Emperours, the Church, and the word?</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt ſent forth his Apoſtles ſaying to them: Preach that the kingdome of heauen is at hand:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</note> heale the ſick; cleanſe the lepers; raiſe vp the dead; caſt out the deuils: freely ye haue receiued, freely giue: poſſeſſe not gold, nor ſiluer nor money in your girdles or purſes, nor a ſcrip for the iourney, neither two coats, neither ſhoes, nor a ſtaf: for the workman is worthy of his meat: and into whatſoeuer Citie or towne ye ſhall come enquire who is worthy in it, and there abide till ye goe thence: and when ye come into an houſe, ſalute the ſame: &amp; if the houſe be worthy, let your peace come vpon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace returne to you: and whoſocuer ſhall not receiue you, nor heare your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or that Citie, ſhake of the duſt of your feet: truly I ſay vnto, it ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be eaſier for them of the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of Iudgement, then for that Citie. Behold I ſend you as ſheep in the middes of the wolues: be ye therefore wiſe as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and innocent as doues: but beware of men, for they will deliuer you vp to the Councels, and will ſcourge you in their Sinagogues: and ye ſhall be brought to the gouernours and kings for my ſake. And ye ſhalbe hated of al men for my names ſake. The Pope and his Biſhops preach not, they haue their gromes to do it, they be greater Lords then Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles: in ſteed of healing the ſick and cleanſing leapers they infect the world with diſeaſes and leaprie ſpirituall: in ſteed of raiſing the dead, they kill the liuing: in ſteed of caſting deuils out, they bring them into the Church of God, they ſerue their turnes with deuils, yea ſerue them and adore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they make ſale of al both the ſpiritual &amp; the temporall: they enioy great Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or dominions, &amp; huge heapes of treaſures: true it is that gray Frieres, Capuchins, &amp; ſome ſort of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks cary not (ſay they) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in their girdles, gold nor ſiluer in their purſes, which I can
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2735:41"/>hardly beleeue, but am rather perſwaded that in this caſe they helpe themſelues with ſome gay ſubteltie of their diuinitie: for they know well enough both to aske and take: the Pope and his Biſhops haue need of an infinit number of horſe &amp; wagons to carry their ſtuff and baggage: they beare no ſtaf with them but they bring armies: no houſe-holder hath ſufficient meanes to defray their charges for one dayes enterteinement: they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are worthy to receiue them, which are moſt fauoured of the world: how ſhould they abide in one houſe, whom the largeſt townes ſuffice to lodge with much adoe? they are frank, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and ſuperſtitious in their falutations, knowing that it is a thing of ſmal coſt: if men heare them not, they do not ſhake of the duſt of their ſhoes, for they are ſo proud that they will not walk a foot in the duſt, but they wil with armes make them ſelues be heard: they want patience to tarry till the Lord ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Iudgement either egall or more rigorous then that of Sodom and Gomorrha, they in all haſt bring fire, ſword and ſacking, as did the Greeks to Troy: they go and demeane them ſelues like wolues in the middes of ſheep: they are guilefull and wary in working their malice as the ſerpent: they haue no need to take heed of men, men loue and deeme them fortunes der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: they neede not be afrayd of kings and their aſſemblies: for at their commaund kings come to them, at their beck doe bow to them, and at their diſcretion ſuffer chaſtiſement: kings are but the Popes miniſters and groomes, they are but execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of his will.</p>
               <p>Ieſus Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles: be not ye called maiſters:

It was Gods pleaſure to haue it ſo, to the end they might declare themſelues ſuch as they are in deed, and make vs ſo much the more without excuſe before his juſtice, if we embrace their opinions; for they beare the mark of diſſalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their names and actions.

               <p>the truth is, that the wonderfull vertue and power of God who conuerteth th'euill of man into good, and vſeth it for his iuſtice, puniſhing ſin by ſin, may not be iudged by the conſtitutions of man &amp; namely by the aboue ſayd; as alſo that we muſt diſcerne, chuſe, &amp; proue Chriſtian doctrine amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſo many errors not by humane reaſons, but by the holy Scripture.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.</note> &amp; ſaued their liues by an excellent deliuerance. This deede was moſt lewd in the brethren of Ioſeph: but moſt good in God, profitable and neceſſarie to his Church: this is that which Ioſeph faith to his brethren: when ye purpoſed euill againſt me, God diſpoſed it to good. The euils and miſeries which God ſendeth to his Church, to his Elect, being conſidered in the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the perſecutors are actions moſt euill: but if we weigh them by the iuſtice and bounty of God, they are iuſt and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. For by the ſame are th'Elect admoniſhed of their faults, and inſtructed that they can not ſtand without Gods grace, and that th'effect of their hopes is reſerued them in an other world: in the meane while they are by thoſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſtayed in th'obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God, their feare is renewed, and their loue and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made more earneſt, then afore. The children of God do marke and eſpie in all the ſinnes and imperfections of men, as it were through the clouds, certaine beames of iuſtice and bountic
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2735:44"/>comming from God, which make them affirme that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from God.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> So S.

So, the ſtubberneſſe of the Iewes in them is moſt bad; in God it is good; and neceſſary for vs being Gentils. By the fall of the Iewes (ſaith S. Paul) ſaluation commeth vnto the Gentils. This is (ſaith he) a great ſecret, that partly blindneſſe of heart is come to Iſrael, vntil the fulneſſe of the Gentils be come in. So, the condemnation and paſſion of Chriſt is our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſoule-health. Antichriſt and his doctors by their ſeducings commit moſt deteſtable ſinnes, and yet do ſuch ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings ſerue to the glory of God.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.</note> S. Paul writeth that God will ſend a ſtrong power of deluſion to the doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that all might be damned which beleeued not the trueth. Then let vs acknowledge with the Scripture, that whatſocuer is done, God doeth it, and that both the good and the euill are done for his iuſtice. This is that great ſecrete of the Apoſtle Paul, which hath not bene communicated to the Pope. This is that which Dauid ſpeaketh of:
<note place="margin">

But albeit cuill actions doo turne to Gods iuſtice, let vs not for all that be the leſſe carefull to eſchew them. For men ceaſe not to be culpable of the euil in their actions; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the deede doing they are not moued thereto by the true zele of Gods iuſtice; but by the deuill, by ſin, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences &amp; wicked deſires. They ſerue God, not thinking of his ſeruice at al, as hath bene noted of Senacherib: for our ſelues, let vs ſerue him in deede and in will, of ſet purpoſe, and not at auenture and as though we thought not of it; let vs betake our hearts and hands to the mouing and guyding of his holy ſpirit; let vs obey his word and we ſhall doe well:

               <p>The Pope teacheth vs that man of himſelfe may doe that which is good. Thus it ſufficed him not impiouſlie to abridge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2735:44"/>the power of God by the former partition, he proceedeth yet to another abridgement thereof by this doctrine. Whereas he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before, that all good actions come from God: now he learneth vs, that man may alſo doo them of himſelfe. But the holy Scripture teacheth vs quite contrarie, that man neither can nor doeth bring any good thing to paſſe; that he is the ſeruant of ſinne; that it is God which worketh the good that is in vs and that commeth from vs; that by the ſinne of Adam we haue bene made ſubiect to ſinne; that ſinne and Gods curſe haue ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our nature, that it neither knoweth, nor can, nor doeth any thing cls, ſaue ſinne: but that God by his grace, by his holy ſpirite geueth vnto thoſe that are his a certaine light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which ſtriueth againſt ſinne; howbeit ſinne moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ouercommeth this light; that God will haue it ſo, to the end his power may be perfected in our infirmitie, and that we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our ſelues in him and his grace, and not in our ſelues &amp; our owne workes. The Lord ſaith:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.</note> we cannot beare good fruite of our ſelues. S. Iames warneth: erre not my deare brethren; euery good geuing, &amp; euery perfect gift is from aboue. S. Paul ſayth:

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> that to ſinne, is to walke after the maner of men, that he doeth not the good thing which hee would, but the euill which hee would not; that it is ſinne which dwelleth in him; that in his fleſh dwelleth no goodnes; that they which are carnall or in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God; that they are in the fleſh which haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt; that we know not our ſelues what we ought to pray for; that the concupiſcence of the fleſh is enmitie againſt God; that we are ſeruants of ſinne. Dauid ſaith,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 14.40.18.</note> that none doth good, no not one; that what men doe in the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their heart and in their counſels, is ſinne.

<note place="margin">

And this doth the Hebrewes ordinarily admoniſh, by the parable of a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, who ſaid abſolutely: I will ſleepe with my ſpouſe this night: and when one of their wiſemen aduiſed him to ſay, if God will, he wilfully replyed: that is in my will and power, will he or will he not, it ſhalbe done: but they were ſcarce in bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they both died: from whence they haue this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe among them: the Bridegroome gets himſelfe to bed, and wots not what may him beſtead. Moreouer, they teach, how the duetie of him that prayeth is to referre the iſſue of his requeſt expreſly to the will of God, and neuer to make his prayer peremptory without exception; which is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood when it is not euident that the holy Ghoſt hath endited our prayer: but hereby appeareth their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what he ought to craue, and therefore is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not his actions alone,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalon.</hi> 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</note> but his petitions alſo and wiſhes to the will of God. So Dauid craueth of God a cleane hart and to haue a right ſpirit renewed within him; he craueth his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he may prayſe the Lord, and that his praier may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. The faithfull haue euermore confeſſed that all their good came from God: the ſame is moſt common in the Scripture;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.</note> it is the voice of the righteous, ſaith Dauid. Vertuous and holy men haue alway in the Church bene named men of God, ſpecially among the Hebrues, who called them likewiſe, men of mercy, as if they would haue ſayd, God beſtowed on
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2735:45"/>them more grace and mercy than on others: contrariwiſe it is the voice of Antichriſt to glorifie the fleſh, to glorifie man, as ſaith S. Peter; as it is the voice of true Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> that our good commeth from aboue; it is not in vs, it is not of vs, it is none of ours. Finally, we learne in the Scripture that the Lords will is not to grant vs full and perfect victory ouer ſinne in this world, leaſt we ſhould proudly brag of the merit of workes. He giueth vs his holy ſpirite, and ſometimes alſo true victorie ouer ſinne, to encourage vs againſt deſpaire in our continuall battaile: but the principall end is that hauing felt our owne feebleforce, and acknowledged our want of power, we might with our whole hart repaire to him, and finding how vaine it is to repoſe truſt in any els, we ſhould of neceſſitie be driuen to confeſſe that we can not be ſaued but by him: which would lead vs with S. Paul to this depth of contemplation;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> who ſhall deliuer vs from the bodie of this death? For ſo S. Paul confeſſed that although he was endued with the holy ſpirit, neuertheleſſe for the moſt part he did not that which he would; and whereas he imputeth the ſame to ſinne that dwelt in him, he confeſſeth himſelfe a ſinner. So doeth the Scripture report to vs the ſinnes of holy perſons, Prophets and Apoſtles enriched with the holy ſpirit. And S. Paul ſaith; that God gaue him a prick in the fleſh,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sathan to buffet him, becauſe he ſhould not be exalted out of meaſure: and therefore was his prayer excluded which he made for his deliuerance vnto God, thus: I be ſought the Lord thriſe, that it might depart from me: and he ſaid vnto me; my grace is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for thee for my power is made perfect through weakneſſe: and therfore the Apoſtle became reſolute to reioice in his infirmities. Let vs come to S. Iohn, who writeth: if we ſay, we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs; we make God a lier &amp; his word is not in vs.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> It is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo that the Lord hath choſen the weak &amp; vile things of this world, to th'end that he which glorifieth himſelfe, ſhould glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Lord.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> And in that regard doth the Apoſtle call the holy ſpirit giuen in this world by God to his elect, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt penny or firſt fruicts of the ſpirit. And in very truth, if we were willing and able to giue aſſured iudgement of our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2735:46"/>ſelues, if we were not vnwilling to bring to light things that are hidden, and the counſels of our hearts: we ſhould perceiue and iudge, that what reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the grace of God ſoeuer we make, we quaile and yeeld not withſtanding for the moſt part. There ſtreameth daily amids our willes and our zele, I wote not what ſenſualitie, concupiſcence, enuie, and infidelitie that ſteyneth our workes. So that if all our actions ſhould be examined by the word of God, not one of them ſhould be found able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his iuſtice. But if we iudge not nor confeſſe them now, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of time wil not amend, or aboliſh their guilt; the preſence of the Lord, how late ſoeuer he commeth, will force vs to confeſſe, for he can well diſcouer and iudge them. Herevpon we may conclude, that in our nature is no goodnes; that the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and good we haue deſcendeth from on high &amp; is brought by the holy ſpirite; that the meaſure of the ſame ſpirit which we enioy in this world, is as nothing in compariſon of that we hope for, is but a skantling, a glimſe, a ſurface or ſmattring, and as it were a ſmacke, to make vs ſeeke, hope, and ardently long for that fulneſſe of perfection which abideth vs in the world to come.</p>
               <p>It ſufficeth not the Pope to teach that man of himſelfe may do ſome good thing;
<note place="margin">Whether a man by his works may merit ought at Gods hand.</note> but he will haue vs further to beleeue that man may do good works inow, to ſaue himſelfe, to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, to repaire and wipe away the ſins and ſteines of his ſoule, of his fleſh and of his predeceſſors, &amp; to merit not only for himſelf, but alſo for many mo that vnmeafureable bliſſe and glory euerlaſting, which the wit of ma is vnable to copreliend. Lo here a flatte contrarietic of the Pope to Chriſt; lo here a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine bearing the right ſtampe of Antichriſt; lo here the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that brings the traffike of Church-men in requeſt: who keepe ſhop for open ſale of mens ſaluation, and make marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of their ſoules through couetouſnes by fayned words, as S.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pes.</hi> 2.</note> Peter hath foreſhewed. We did ſufficiently deface this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when we proued afore, that man could doe no good; that for the little good which commeth from man, it is God that doeth it in him and by him. Howbeit, the holy Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth vs how God gaue his law to men, not for to geue life,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2735:46"/>iuſtifie and ſaue them by the ſame,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.</note> but to make them know the vnablenes, frailtic and corruption of their nature, and to force them to acknowledge it impoſſible for man to performe his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the maieſtie of God, to ſatisfie his debt to the iuſtice of God, and to eſcape eternal death: which ſhould compel them with all humblenes to crie and craue forgeuenes, grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Obedience to the law was inioyned vpon paine of death;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 2.</note> &amp; it is ſaid, that whoſoeuer ſhall keepe the whole law, and yet fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in one poynt, he is guilty of all. Now there is not one man found, be he Prophet or Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> which hath not diſobeyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commandements of the law: and therefore th'Apoſtle ſaith, that the Scripture hath ſhut vp all vnder ſin, that the promiſe by faith in Chriſt Ieſus might be geuen to them that beleeue. There is none iuſt, no not one, all are vnder ſin:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 43.</note> we deceiue our ſelues, we make God a lyer if we ſay we haue no ſinne. Let vs be iudged together (ſaith the Lord in Iſay,) count thou that thou mayſt be iuſtified: thy firſt father hath ſinned, and thy teachers haue tranſgreſſed againſt me or bettayed my cauſe. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles haue all frankly acknowledged themſelues ſinners, they could neither accompliſh the law nor be ſaued thereby. This acknowledgement of himſelfe, his corruption, ſinne &amp; weakenes hath prouoked and enforced man to cry for mercie to the Lord, and ſay with Dauid and Paul:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgeuen, and woſe ſinnes are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne. Againe: haue mercy on me, haue mercy on me;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 52.</note> for my ſoul tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in thee: &amp; with Eſdras: there is no man among them that be borne but he hath done wickedly,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 8.</note> nor any that doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thee, which hath not done amiſſe: for in this (ô Lord) thy righteouſnes and thy goodnes ſhalbe prayſed if thou be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vntothem, which haue not the ſubſtance of good workes:
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 7.</note> and elſwhere: if God were not aboundant in his mercies the world could not contime, nor they that haue the poſſeſſion thereof. No man can humble himſelfe enough before God, no man can too baſely eſteeme himſelfe before his moſt glorious maieſtie: pride did put the Pharifee farre from God; humilitie brought the Publican neere him: pride caried our firſt Father
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2735:47"/>out of the moſt honourable ſubiection of the Lord. Pride is the originall and cauſe of Antichriſt and of backſliding, as ſaith Eſdras.
<note place="margin">6. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 8.</note> Our Lord God hath fought ſo openly and with ſo great care againſt this opinion of merite by workes, that I am aſtonied with wonder that men who ſay they are Chriſtians, durſt thinke, decree, publiſh and receiue the ſame.

<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> agayne, that no fleſh ſhalbe iuſtified by the works of the law: that whoſoeuer will be iuſtified by the law, are aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from Chriſt, and are fallen from grace: that they deſpiſe the ſpirite of grace:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> that if righteouſnes is by the law, Ieſus Chriſt died in vaine.
<note place="margin">

This is the doctrine publiſhed alſo with ſo great earneſtnes in all th'epiſtle to the Hebrewes. Then let vs condemne this doctrine of the Pope, it exalteth the fleſh; it placeth the power of fleſh and bloud in place where God ſhould be; it diſanulleth and maketh voyde the loue, the comming the word, the death and paſſion and merite thereof, the grace &amp; mercie of Chriſt Ieſus. It is ſcornefully to abaſe &amp; ſpitefully to defie the election and councels, the iuſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord; it is to deſpiſe the ſpirite of grace; it is to goe about to aſſaile and breake in vpon the Lord in his own Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> it is to deny the Lord that hath bought vs, as ſaith S. Peter:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2735:47"/>that to bring into the Church the merit of works, is (according to the ſame S. Peters ſaying) to tempt God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</note> to lay a yoke on the Diſciples neckes which neither our fathers nor we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare: it is to ouerthrow the counſel holden by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Citie of Ieruſalem, wherein was concluded that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation depended not of workes, but onely of the grace of the Lord. Let vs refuſe this pride of the fleſh, leaſt we be aboliſhed of Chriſt and fall from grace. Leaue we theſe marks of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to the Pope, leaue we him with all the wicked to awayte for the merite of their works; while we with all the faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayte for the grace and mercy of God. Let vs not deceiue our ſelues, but confeſſe that all are ſhut vp in vnbeleefe, that Ieſus Chriſt might ſhew mercie vpon all. Then let vs flie vnto him both willingly and for neceſſitie ſake. And as we triumph with S.

So it is writte, that the Lord opened the heart of Lydia the ſeller of purple to attend to the things which S. Paul ſpake.

               <p>But ſome do argue againſt the word of God in theſe termes:
<note place="margin">Faith doth not aboliſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> workes.</note> Seing that grace aboliſheth merit, works are aboliſhed likewiſe: and ſo the Goſpell aboliſheth workes and the law by faith. S. Paul did fore-ſee this obiection, and aunſwered thereto ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that none except the ignoraunt or enemies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, can make accompt thereof. Neuertheleſſe the Pope ſtands on it ſo ſtifly, and eſteemes it ſo highly, that in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and vnder colour of it and his auarice together he hath brought in this goodly doctrine of the merite of workes contrary to the Goſpell, as by the premiſſes here-aboue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4.</note> After Saint Paul had ſet downe this obiection, he proueth more manifeſtly than afore, that by faith we are ſaueck and ſtayeth firmely on this argument; that Abraham receiued the promiſe of ſaluation by faith, before the circumciſion, and long time yer the law was geuen, ſo that the promiſe (ſaith he) belongeth to the faithfull and not to the workers of the law: which law was geuen onely to the ſucceſſors of Abraham, after
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2735:50"/>faith and the promiſes: and ſo he leaueth vs to conclude, that as the law was geuen to the ſucceſſors of Abraham after the promiſes made to Abraham becauſe of his faith: euen ſo the faithfull ought to receiue the law, not making it the cauſe of the promiſes and hand-faſt of their ſaluation; but ſhewing by their obedience thereto that the promiſes belong to them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſors of them to whom the promiſes were made, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſors of Abraham, yea children of the heauenly father, whoſe voice they ought to know and vnderſtand, yelding them ſelues willingly to be guyded and gouerned by his holy ſpirite, to the obedience of his commandements. The ſonne is a ſonne afore he obeyeth his father, but he ſheweth by his obedience, that he is the trueſonne: ſo the faithfull and elect, afore workes, afore their obedience appeareth, be the children of God. Works cannot bring them this title or qualitie, it is the gift of God and commeth not of works, ſaith S. Paul:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſa.</hi>
                  </note> but by workes they ſhewe themſelues to be faithfull in deede; and by the obedience they yeeld to God when he hath certified them of his wil, they ſhew themſelues to be the true and faithfull children of God. S.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> Paul is not content herewith, but purſueth yet more euidently the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of this obiection. For hauing proued afore, that wee are ſaued by grace and not by works, it followeth: what ſhal we ſay then? ſhall we continue ſtil in ſinne, that grace may abound? God forbid, how ſhall we, that are dead to ſinne, liue yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? know ye not that all we which haue bene baptized into Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, haue bene baptized into his death? wee are buried then with him by baptiſme into his death, that like as Chriſt was rayſed vp from the dead by the glory of the father, ſo we alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life, and in the ſame Chapter: what then? ſhall we ſinne, becauſe we are not vnder the law, but vnder grace? God forbid: know ye not that to whomſother ye geue your ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſeruants ye are to whoth ye obey: and a little after; but now being freed from ſinue, and made ſeruants vnto God ye haue your fruite in holmes, and th'end euerlaſting life. Thus yee ſee that faith deſtroyeth not workes. Contrariwiſe, the Scripture commandeth vs that we oboy God to ſhew foorth the glory and holines of his houſe, to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2735:51"/>ſhew and confirme our owne and our neighbors faith; to ſhew that we feare, loue and honor God; that we belong to him, are regenerated by him, are his children &amp; ſeruants: and this ought we to ſeeke in works, and not our ſaluation. Workes goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore election; they follow it: they follow adoption, they follow faith, they follow the ſure truſt of ſaluation. The commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God are directed to them that are of his houſe &amp; not to ſtrangers: ſo that we muſt be of his houſe before we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or do them. The commaundements are not they that make the children, but they are the children that doo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of their father. But now behold how we learne what is th'end of good works.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pes.</hi> 2.</note> It is written that it is the will of God, that by wel doing we may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men, as free and not as hauing the libertie for a cloke of maliciouſnes but as the ſeruants of God.

Saint Iohn ſaith: hereby we are ſure that we know him, if we keepe his commandements; he that ſaith I know him and keepeth not his commaundements, is a lier, and the truth is not in him: he that ſaith, he remaineth in him ought euen ſo to walk, as he hath walked.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> but according to the will of God. They muſt haue their conuerſation honeſt, that they which ſpeake euill of them as of euill doers, may by their good works, which they ſhall ſee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in the day of the viſitation. True it is that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemeth in ſome places to aſcribe ſaluation to works for the holy Ghoſt ſometimes vſeth indifferently all theſe termes, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, grace, faith, works, and accepteth th'one for th'other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to ſhew vs that th'election, grace, faith and works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable: and as it is written that works done without faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile nothing; ſo true works bring with them faith, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2735:51"/>th'election and grace purchaſed by the paſſion of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Sometimes alſo the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh in this maner to rebuke them that abuſe faith, running after a baſtard, vaine and idle faith, leauing the lawfull, true and working faith. At other times heſpeaketh ſo, applying himſelfe to nouices and children in the faith. For ſo S. Iames highly extolled workes;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 2.</note> but that was vpon occaſion, to confound them that abuſed faith, and thought they ſhould continue vnprofitable and idle in faith. As alſo S.

<note place="margin">Whether the body of Ieſus Chriſt be really in the bread of the holy ſupper.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope commaundeth to beleeue, that the body &amp; bloud of Ieſus Chriſt are really and in deed, in the bread and wine of the ſupper. He commaundeth that the bread of the ſupper be adored as God. I maruéile that he makes not the wine be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2735:52"/>adored, for the reaſon of both is all one. He hath ordeined a daily ſacrifice of this body, &amp; for to commend this ſacrifice the more, he hath prouided it a ſeruice of the church, altar, ſacrificers, prieſts, and other officers, prieſtly omaments, oeremonies &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions in words &amp; geſtures, in water, fire &amp; otherthings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in-deed a mingle mangle of all religions that euer were. He grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reall &amp; corporall preſence of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; bloud, and of the ſubſtantiall turning or chaunge of the truth of the bread &amp; wine into the ſubſtance &amp; truth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; bloud of the Lord,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 26.</note> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe words of S. Matthew ſaying: Ieſus tooke bread, &amp; after he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks he brake it, &amp; gaue it to his diſciples, and ſaid: take, eat, this is my body: &amp; hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the cup, &amp; giuen thanks, he gaue it them, ſaying: drinke ye all of it; for this is my bloud of the new teſtament which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins. Now they may eaſely iudge, who peruſe the holy ſcripture wholy with an open heart, the eyes of whoſe vnderſtanding are not dym, that this doctrine of the Pope tooke his beginning &amp; being in the phantaſie of man, rather then in the Scripture. For if we gather and compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whatſoeuer the Scripture doth conteine touching the Lordes ſupper, we ſhall finde that the body is not in the bread, but is at the right hand of God; and yet the faithfull do eate and drinke ſpiritually and by faith the body and bloud of our Sauiour, receiuing therewith the merite of his death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and are nouriſhed ſpiritually by his grace; and that the bread and wine are ſet forth for ſignes of the Sacrament, to ſignifie to vs that as bread and wine nouriſh vs for our temporall life, ſo the body &amp; bloud of the Lord do nouriſh vs for the life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; and as there is an vnion &amp; meeting together of many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the bread &amp; in the wine, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſhould there be an vnion and agreement among the faithfull in communicating of the body and bloud of the Lord. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chirſt had ſaid, this is my body,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.</note> this is my bloud of the new teſtament, he addeth: I ſay vnto you I will not drinke hence-forth of this fruict of the vine; [I will not drinke more of the fruict of the vine] vntill that day, when I ſhall drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdome. Theſe wordes taken either ſpiritually or after the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2735:52"/>letter do ſufficiently declare that the wine is not turned into the bloud of our Sauiour for he calleth it ſtill the fruict of the vine. And in Saint Luke to diſcouer vnto vs more clearely that this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.</note> ſpeach is figuratiue, he ſaith: this is my body; do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me: this cup is the new teſtament in my bloud which is ſhed for you: he ſaith not the cup is my bloud; but it is the new teſtament in my bloud: that is to ſay, it is a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a ſigne of my bloud, a teſtament, a title and contract of new alliance in my bloud. This ſenſe and vnderſtanding is not beſide the purpoſe: for he celebrated that ſame day with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples th'ancient Sacrament of the paſſe-ouer lambe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the lambe of God, that ſhould come to make vs through his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe out of this tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitory world full of miſeries &amp; bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage into th'other would full of ſurpaſſing ioy and libertie. And for that this auncient Sacrament of the paſſe-ouer lambe was to take an end forthwith by his death, he inſtituted the new ſacrament of the new teſtament, of the new league or alliance: be gaue them bread and wine for ſignes of the ſpirituall nouriſhment which they were neceſſarily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the body and bloud of our Sauiour. And as in the old alliance or teſtament the lambe was not Chriſt, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Chriſt: ſo the bread and wine of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not the body and bloud, but ſignifie and repreſent the body and bloud of Chriſt. This interpretation is confirmed moreouer by theſe wordes; do this in remembraunce of me: it is ordinary to commend by ſignes and reſemblances the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of things abſent, and not of things preſent on th'other ſide if we are to take the words in S. Luke literally without admitting any expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſide the letter, the wine is no more the bloud, it is now the cup, it muſt then be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed that theſe words are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue and ſubiect to another interpretation then the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fignification of the letter will bearenſ there be any figure in S. Luke, there may be alſo the like in S. Matthew. It is written in S. Paul: the cup of bleſſing, which we bleſſe,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the bread which we breaked is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt &amp; for we th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are one bread and one body becauſe we all are partakers
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2735:53"/>of one bread. He ſaith not, that the bread and wine are the body and bloud, but that they are the communion of the body and bloud: theſe wordes can none otherwiſe be interpreted, but that the bread and wine ſignifie the communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud; ſeing that the bread &amp; wine can not be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for the communion is a thing ſpirituall, &amp; hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in the ſpirite and conſideration of man; which can not agree with the bread. Againe, if we muſt ground this doctrine on the letter, the wine is not the communion of the bloud, that which is the bloud (as you ſay) is the chalice. The ſame Apoſtle ſaith in another place: I haue receiued of the Lord that which I alſo haue deliuered to you; to wit: that the Lord Ieſus in the ſame night that he was betrayed tooke bread; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thanks, he brake it, &amp; ſaid: take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you, this doo ye in remembrance of me. After the ſame maner alſo he tooke the cup when he had ſupped, ſaying: this cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud; this do, as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me; for as often as ye ſhall eate this bread and drinke this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death til he come. Wherefore, whoſoeuer ſhall eate this bread, and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, ſhalbe guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. Let a man therefore examine himſelfe and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup: for he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, becauſe he diſcerneth not the Lords body. See here againe, how the Lord commaundeth by th'Apoſtle, that the holy ſupper be made in remembrance of him; likewiſe he ſaith not, wine, he ſaith, the cup. See here alſo, how the cup or the wine is not the bloud, but the new Teſtament in the bloud of the Lord. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the bread and the cup are there named ſtill the bread and the cup, before and after the bleſſing, diſtributing, eating and drinking: which ſheweth vs, that albeit the bread and wine ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the body and bloud of our Sauiour, they remayn notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in their true and natural ſubſtance, they remaine bread and wine, halowed neuertheles for the vſe ſake, but no way va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried &amp; altred for the ſubſtance. Had they bene tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated into the body &amp; bloud, th'Apoſtle after the celebration, after
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2735:53"/>the participating, had not ſaid, as often as ye ſhal eate this bread &amp; drink this cup; whoſoeuer ſhall eate this bread &amp; drink this cup: he would haue ſaid; as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ye ſhall eat this body &amp; drink this bloud; whoſoeuer ſhal eat this body and drinke this bloud. True it is that he ſaith; he that ſhall eat and drinke vnworthily, ſhalbe guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord: but that is to ſhew, how this eating and drinking is holy and ſacred, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to vs the death and paſſion of the Lord, th'oblation and ſuffering of the body, the ſheading of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, the nouriſhment of the ſoule. This teacheth vs our dutie, to take this bread and this wine with an holy and religious reuerence; for the queſtion in this ſacrament ſtandeth vpon the body and bloud of our Sauiour, and not ſo much on bread &amp; wine, which are not but ſignes. And here behold why the holy Ghoſt ſaith freely, that bread and wine are the body and bloud of the Lord. But now commeth a place very notable and vnanſwereable, a moſt expreſſe and pregnant place to them which are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Lords voyce. In S. Iohn ye may read,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> how Ieſus Chriſt preching in the ſynagogue at Capernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hauing ſaid, I am the liuing bread, &amp; the bread that I wil giue, is my fleſh; then the Iewes ſtroue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſaying: how can this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue vs his fleſh to eate? then Ieſus ſayd vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: except ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud ye haue no life in you: whoſoeuer eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlaſting, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day: for my fleſh is meat indeed, &amp; my bloud is drinke indeed: many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his diſciples (when they heard this) ſaid, this is an hard ſaying; who can heare it. But Ieſus knowing within himſelfe that his diſciples murmured at this, ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: doth this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you? what if ye ſhall ſee the Sonne of man aſcend where he was afore? it is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: the wordes that I ſpeake to you are ſpirit and life: but there are ſome among you, which beleeue not. Thus we can not doubt but that this manner of ſpeaking, to eat and drinke the body and bloud of the Lord, is ſpirituall, ſeeing the Lord doeth aſcertaine it by name. Ye are aſtoniſhed, ſaieth he, at this ſaying of mine, ye muſt eat and drinke my body and my bloud: ye will
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2735:54"/>find theſe wordes much more ſtrange, when I ſhall aſcend into heauen with my body: for then will it ſeeme to you a great deale harder to eat my body being ſo farre diſtant from you. Ye muſt not conceiue my words ſo: it is not my body that ye muſt eat, it is the merit of the death and paſſion of my body, it is my iuſtifying grace that ye muſt eat and receyue by faith and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> wherewith ye muſt be quickened. My words are ſpirit and life; it is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We may moreouer out of this place draw many other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to eſtabliſh our beliefe, that the words of eating and drinking the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt ought not to be taken but ſpiritually, were it needfull to confirme that, which himſelfe hath ſo cleerely expounded. he ſaith, if ye eate not the fleſh of the Sonne of man and drinke his bloud, ye ſhal haue no life in you. now to ſtay on the letter of theſe termes &amp; not take them ſpiritually, would cauſe a great blaſphemy to enſue. for how many men are there in the world which neuer eat the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ieſus Chriſt, and yet haue life in them? but our Sauiour in plaine termes ſaith they haue no life: chuſe then, either to giue him the lye which were blaſphemous, or els confeſſe that he ſpeaketh ſpiritually, and that, by life, he meaneth ſpirituall life. Which being ſo, why do we not alſo acknowledge that theſe wordes of eating and drinking the body and bloud of the Lord are ſpirituall, and ought to be vnderſtood of th'eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which the ſoule doeth by faith: ſpecially ſeing he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth himſelfe both for th'one and th'other according to this ſenſe. for after he had ſpoken ſimplie of life, he addeth: he that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlaſting: likewiſe after he had ſaid fimplie, that wee muſt eat and drinke his fleſh and his bloud, he addeth: ye ſhal not eate my body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread deſcended from heauen, as your fathers did eat Manna: that is to ſay, ye ſhall not eat it with carnall teeth, as your fathers did eat Manna, for they did eat that carnally, but ye ſhall eat this ſpiritually. Moreouer, to ſhew that this ſpeach is ſpirituall, and that his body and bloud ſhould be taken ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and by faith, he ſaith: I am the bread of life, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me ſhall haue no hunger, and he that beleeueth in me
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2735:54"/>ſhall haue no thirſt: for there he ſpeaketh of ſpirituall hunger and thirſt, and referreth all to faith. On th'other ſide, if we take the body and bloud of our Sauiour carnally &amp; with the mouth, it ſhould folow, that S. Paul is contrary to Chriſt. For he ſaith,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> that by eating and drinking we profit nothing to Chriſt, that meate maketh vs not acceptable to God; if wee eate, ſayth hee, it aduantageth vs not, and if we doo not eate, wee haue neuer the leſſe: and yet in S. Iohn, Chriſt ſayth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> that if wee eate not his fleſh, wee ſhall not haue life euerlaſting. In like ſort S. Paul ſaith,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> that whoſoeuer ſhall eate vnworthily the bread of the ſupper, he ſhalbe guiltie of the Lords body: and yet Chriſt teacheth vs. that whatſoeuer entreth by the mouth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</note> defileth not the man. We cannot agree S. Paul with Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt with himſelfe, if we affirme not that the Lord and S. Paul doo ſpeake in the one place, to wit, concerning the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of ſpirituall eating; and in the other, of corporall eating. In ſuch wiſe, that S. Paules doctrine remayneth true, where he ſaith, that by eating and drinking we profit nothing towarde Chriſt, albeit that we muſt eate and drinke the body and bloud of our Sauiour, as himſelfe ſaith, for it is ſpiritually that we muſt eate and drinke, of which maner of eating &amp; drinking the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle purpoſed not to ſpeake at all in this place: the doctrine of Chriſt alſo abideth ſure, that whatſoeuer entreth by the mouth, defileth not the ſoule; albeit th'Apoſtle ſaith, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer receiueth the bread of the ſupper vnworthely, maketh himſelfe guilty of the Lords body: for the abuſe which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in receiuing the bread of the ſupper, is principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſoule, conſcience and faith. Lo, this ſpeech of the holy ſupper, is like to that of Ieſus to Nicodemus:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> truely I ſay to thee, that he which is not borne againe cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. How may a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith Nicodernus, be born whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is old? can he enter againe into his mothers wombe &amp; be borne? Ieſus anſwereth, truely, truly I ſay vnto thee, that whoſoeuer is not borne of water and of the ſpirite, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God: that which is borne of fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit. Maruell not at that which I haue told thee, we muſt be borne from aboue: the winde blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2735:55"/>where it will, and thou heareſt the voice, but knoweſt not from whence it commeth, nor whither it goeth: euen ſo is euery man that is borne of the ſpirit. We all agree, that this maner of being borne againe is ſpirituall, for otherwiſe it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature. Now, ſo it is, that we haue many mo reaſons and conſiderations; which enforce vs to beleeue, that this maner of eating and drinking the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. For beſides that the holy Ghoſt hath declared the one and the other forme of ſpeech to be ſpirituall: it is altogether impoſſible in nature, that one body ſhould be turned into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuers in kind, by words and in a moment. This cannot be in nature that a liuing body ſhould become of the ſubſtance of any other body without death or corruption, it cannot haue change from ſubſtance into ſubſtance without corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being not that which it was afore;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.</note> the Lord himſelf ſaith, it is a thing impoſſible. The Pope ſaith not, that by this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation the body of Chriſt dieth and corrupteth; that were to heape vp too many blaſphemies and hereſies one vpon another; and were it ſo, Chriſt were to die and ſuffer infinite times,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.</note> which is flat againſt the ſcripture. For it is written, that he died once for all; that he made one onely oblation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinne; that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for euer at the right hand of God. His body is glorified, it is no more ſubiect to ſuffering and corruption. Againe, we ſee not the bread corrupt, it appeareth after the breaking and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as faire and vnaltred bread, as afore. On the other part, it is impoſſible in nature, that a body, ſuch as we ought to beleeue that of Ieſus Chriſt hath bene and is, to wit, a true body, can at the ſelfe ſame time be in diuers places. If the body of Chriſt is in the bread of the ſupper, it is in places innumerable at the ſame time; it is in heauen, it is in earth in ſundry &amp; infinit parts thereof. This properly is to deny Ieſus Chriſt to become in the fleſh,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</note> which is a marke of Antichriſt, as ſaith S. Iohn. Is there any thing more contrarie to ſenſe, to reaſon, to charitie, to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, to the feare, honor &amp; loue which we by duetie muſt beare towards God? is there any thing more impoſſible, tha to breake, chew and ſwalow the body of our Lord, his glorified body, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2735:55"/>breake, teare &amp; rend it in peeces, to make him die whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles aſſure vs eternally doth liue at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God? the curſe of God hath bene &amp; yet is on them that did put him once to death; &amp; think ye,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.</note> that put him to death euery day ſo much as in you lieth, to eſcape the curſe of God? If Chriſt his body is in the bread the propheſie cited by S. Iohn, ye ſhall not breake a bone of him, is in great ieoperdie: for the Prieſtes vndiſcretly breake the bread, without looking where the bones be. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth of old that in the law of Moſes,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuis.</hi> 4.5.</note> they did not eat of the beaſt, which was ſacrificed for ſinne; to foreſhew, that the true ſacrifice for ſinne ſhould be made by Ieſus Chriſt, of whoſe body we ſhould not eate: hereupon S. Paul,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> after the recitall of this auncient ſacrifice, ſaith; we haue an altar, whereof they may not eate, which ſerue in the tabernacle. Let vs conſider withall, that the corporall preſence of Ieſus Chriſt in the bread and wine of the holy ſupper here below, is contrary to th'arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the faith, for we beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen; that he ſitteth on the right hand of the father;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3.</note> that he ſhall come to iudge the quick and the dead. Let vs confider how S. Peter ſaith, that the heauen muſt conteine Ieſus Chriſt vntill the time that all things be reſtored. S. Paul ſaith:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</note> ſeeke the things that are on high where Ieſus Chriſt ſitteth at the hand of God: for himſelfe had ſaid to his Apoſtles,

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2735:56"/>appearing ſhalbe for iudgement? why doth he ſay himſelfe; yet a litle while and you ſhall ſee me no more, for I go to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? when is that time among the Papiſtes, wherein they ſee him not? why do the Angels ſay; this Ieſus, which is taken vp from you to heauen, ſhall come euen ſo as ye haue ſeen him go vp to heauen? who hath ſeen him come downe from heauen, to ſhut himſelfe within the bread, as he was ſeen go vp to heauen? The Pope putteth his onely truſt in this aunſwere: the Lord (ſaith he) can make his body be in the bread, <hi>ergò</hi> he is there. Behold a very proper meane to proue readily all kinds of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, phantaſies, and mockeries: and in deed, if we were ſure that his will is to haue his body here below in the bread in places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, &amp; aboue at his fathets right hand, and ſo to haue his body to be ſpirituall; we would not doubt of his power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it: but we can find no-where this wil of his: contrari-wiſe he teacheth vs, that his body is in heauen, that in the ſupper we muſt lift vp our ſoules on high to the right hand of God, there to eate ſpiritually and by faith, as hath beneſaid: he teacheth vs, that his body is a true body:
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.</note> euery ſpirit (ſaith S. Iohn) which confeſſeth not, that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God; ſuch a ſpirit is the ſpirit of Antichriſt: thus let vs enſue his will without enquiring of his power. Furthermore if we might certeinely ſee the body, or the'effects of the preſence of the body and bloud of our Lord in the holy ſupper, in the bread and wine thereof, we would not argue at all either of his power or of his will, but we ſee nothing ſaue bread, like to bread both within and without, in and throughout euery part, in colour &amp; other qualities, of nature nouriſhable and corruptible: the hoſt of the Maſſe nouriſheth man, nouriſheth wormes, as bread doth; corrupteth and putrifieth, as bread; which we may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue of our Sauiours glorified body. Withall, if the body of the Lord were in the bread, ſo many miracles ſhould daily and hourely enſue,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.</note> as would make it paſt doubt: they, that touched his garments onely, felt his wonderfull vertue: with farre more likelihood ſhould they, that touch his body, feele it: but we can ſee no ſuch effects. the Popes, Biſhops and Prieſts haue aſſayed to deriue from it oracles and miracles, but ſtill they found it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2735:56"/>els ſaue bread, they haue chafed thereat ſo farre-forth as to caſt the hoſt into the fire. Finally, I ſee no ſuch neceſſitie for the celebration of the ſupper, that the body ſhould be here below really within the bread, no more then in old time Chriſt was in the labe, or at this day the bloud of Chriſt is in the water of baptiſme. The faithfull doe effectually receiue in baptiſme the waſhing of the bloud of Chriſt by faith, although nothing but water be adminiſtred in the name of the father, of the ſonne and of the holy Ghoſt: euen ſo the faithfull may partake in the grace, iuſtification, death &amp; paſſion, in the body &amp; bloud of the Lord by ſpirituall eating, through faith; as well, yea more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly then by the reall eating of the body. For in this behalfe it behoueth the Spirit by his miraculous operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not onely to tranſubſtantiate the body, and make it preſent at the ſame time in places infinit, but alſo to turne this corporall food into ſpirit for the ſpirituall ſuſtenance of the ſpirit of man; which is the principall end of the ſupper, of the death &amp; paſſion of the Lord. It is more agreable to the order eſtabliſhed by God in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all things and more conſonant to his counſels reueled in his word to lift vp our ſoules by faith, to nouriſh them with his body and bloud, to fill them with his grace, and merite of his death and paſſion, &amp; to notifie ſuch inward actions by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes of bread and wine, then to confound the properties of both natures, to make him a body euerywhere preſent, which to be onely pertaineth to his diuinitie, to abaſe his glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſubiect it to a world of phantaſies, profanations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, to haue it broken and torne, chewed and ſwalowed, and further to change that body into ſpirit for the nouriſhment of the ſpirit. Behold here how the Pope with too-much boldnes, and no neceſſitie aduentureth to commit idolatrie himſelfe, and to make them groſe idolaters which follow him in his doctrine, in that he adoreth the bread of the ſupper euen as the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. More ſafe it is to adore it at the right hand of God, ſeing the Scripture aſſureth vs moſt certainely that he is there. Idolatrie is a ſinne too horrible, that any man ſhould ſo freely giue ouer himſelfe to the ſame. In ſuch ventrous caſes, when there is any ſuſpition of idolatrie, feare to ſinne ought aboue all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2735:57"/>to ouer-rule our worldly wiſdome. Away then with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Pope ſo contrary to th'articles of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and all the holy Scripture, away with this doctrine that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the veritie of our Lords body, and is ſuſpected, ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The Pope willeth vs to haue images of Angels,

He willeth vs to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſerue theſe images with ſuch deuotion &amp; ceremonies, as in effect differeth not from adoration or diuine-honour. We find no iote in the Scripture conformable to this doctrine; but we find there commaundements ynow moſt flatly forbidding vs to receiue it.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.</note> It is written, ye ſhall make you no idols, nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen image, neither reare you vp any piller, neither ſhall ye ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny image of ſtone in your land to bow downe to it: for I am the Lord your God: again, thou ſhalt not reare thee vp an idol, for the Lord hateth it. In the table giuen to Moſes it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: thou ſhalt make thee no grauen image, neither any likenes of things that are in heauen aboue, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the water vnder the earth; thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, nor ſerue them. For I am the Lord thy God, a iealous God, viſiting th'iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children. This commaundement doeth ſo ſharply vrge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and fauourers of images, that they may in no wiſe excuſe or colour their diſobedience. the Lord ſaith in expreſſe termes, thou ſhalt not bow downe to them nor ſerue them, to ſtop their mouths that bring in a diſtinction of adorations: it is a ſmaller matter to bow our ſelfe before images and ſerue them, then it is to ſolemniſe and ſing maſſes in their honour, to ſalute them, kneele before them, offer them candles, make prayers, vowes, pilgrimages and proceſſions to them, with like, nay with more affection, humilitie, worſhip &amp; hope then is done to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they faſt in their honour, they prepare themſelues before they will touch them, with more deuotion and care then when they go to receyue the ſacrament; they come not nigh them but bare-foot, and in their ſhirt alone. The ſmalleſt lets and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities do turne you backe from the houſe of God: but all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2735:57"/>the annoyances and iniuries of th'ayer and of men; of cold, heat, wind, and raine; throng of people and blowes can not ſtay you from crouding, creeping, and approching to them, for to enioy this bliſſe, this contentment in your ſoule, in your deuotions onely to touch or cauſe them to be touched with ſome thing ye haue about you; and thenceforth vee thinke your deuotions more perfect and accompliſhed, then if an Angel of heauen were come to witneſſe it to you, as was to Tobie. Ye offer to them that which they ſee not; ye aske them that which they vnderſtand not: ye looke at their handes for that, which God alone can do and giue. if all theſe humilities, deuout and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious affections deſerue not the name of adoration, I wot not what we may call adoration. When the Iſraelites went vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temple to adore the Lord, they did not ſomuch as ye do before your images. It appeareth in the Acts &amp; Reuelation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.22.</note> that to adore is to kneele before any thing with religious deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now at leaſt if in your deed be no adoration, yet is there bowing and ſeruice which are th'expreſſe termes of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. There is another word in this commaundement throughly to be conſidered of vs, he forbids images with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeruing of them; for (ſaith he) I am thy ielous God. It is not for nought that he vſeth this terme ielous; ielouſie admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no excuſe; ielouſie is ſtrong as the graue; where ielouſie is, ye can not ſhew ſo few courteſies to others, but ye ſhall ſhew too many. Your fathers, maiſters and doctours tell you that images are permitted in your Church onely for remembraunce ſake, that none but the ſimpler ſort do giue their minds to reuerence them, bow before them, &amp; ſerue them, thus they condemn your actions, your deuotions &amp; their owne, they deeme you and them ſelues alſo idolaters: for they make the greater preſſe, they goe before, they gather vp the profites of the offrings they lay the other offrings to pledge as the dolphin layeth other fiſhes to pledge in the whales belly, they take vp the reſt of the candels. But were it, that they with-held themſelues, yet ceaſe they not to be guiltie of th'offence committed about theſe images,

Thus the Scripture teacheth vs that it is ſinne to make images onely for Religion ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning any bowing of the body or ſeruice; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to graue, karue or peinct th'image of God.

It is high time than for vs to giue ouer all theſe images, and content our ſelues with the Word which is the true image of God: it is in vayne to looke for any liuely ſhew or feeling at the dead works of mens hands: it is the holy Ghoſt that imprinteth in our myndes all right knowledge, and from whom we feele all true comfort: let vs craue it of him and leaue crouching to images.

We finde no ſuch matter in the holy Scripture; but doo finde the ſcripture againſt it both in ſubſtance of ſence and forme of words. The Iſraelites vnder the law were not yet ſo aſſured of the bountie, grace and familiaritie of God towards men, as we are at this day ſince the comming of our Sauiour. They durſt

<note place="margin">

But aboue all they had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who had by the power of God miraculouſly brought them out of the bondage of Aegypt, that made them on drie foote paſſe woonderfullie through the red ſea, that prouided them bread, fleſh and drinke in the wildernes, deliuered them the law of the Lord, with whom they ſaw him familiarly talke, that brought them to the land of promiſe: and many times, while he liued, called on God for them and appeaſed him, what great power, vertue, and high degree of knowledge the Iſraelites attributed to Moſes aboue all others, except the Meſſias, is knowen. Howbeit we find not that after his death they directed any prayers to him, they made neither to him nor to others any bowing or ſeruice, that I ſpeake not of diuine worſhips which ye ſhew euery day to an infinite multitude of Saincts. The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſought him after his death neither in heauen or earth, they called not on him as their Mediator or interceſſor; they made no images of him to whom they might bring candles, make prayers and ſing hymnés with crowching and deuotion, but here-againſt, the holy Ghoſt aduertiſeth vs that he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the valley of Nebo in the land of Moab,

There is no realme, no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, no towne, no pariſh, no miſtery, vocation, fraternitie, ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no familie, no man, that hath not choſen ſome particular Sainct for his Patron, whom he moſt mindeth. And by ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages ye make more ſtreict diuiſions among you, then did the Corinthians; ye go on euen to armes, euen to murthers and ſeditions, for each of you to maintaine the honour and greater might (as ye ſuppoſe) of your Sainct and patron; ſtriuing who may faine moſt fables and follies of their miracles: I am of S. Denis, ſaith one, and I of S. Peter ſaith another; another is of S. Martin; another of S. Mark; another of S. Auſtin; another of S. Bernard; another of S. Francis; another of S. Iames; another of S. Antony; another of Ieſus. In ſumme, each order of religion hath his patron: it is ordinary to heare euery order vaunt that there is no holines and might but in their ſainct, there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation but in him; all th'others be deceiuers; all men are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſaue they: if theſe Patrons haue the ſame zele which th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had, they will be ſo farre from ſuccouring you, that they will accuſe you before God of all theſe follies and ſuperſtitions; they will vtterly diſauow all theſe impieties, which you intrude vpon them without their will or warrant. But yet, why call we on Saincts &amp; Angels as mediatours &amp; interceſſors? who taught vs it? The Lord forgate not to teach, how we ſhould pray; he neuer did put vs in remembrance to call on Angels &amp; Saincts: he bad vs direct our prayers to God, and call him our father; he aſſured vs to obteyne whatſoeuer we ſhould aske in his owne name; he made no mention of the name of Angels and Saincts. the Prophets and Apoſtles treated in like ſort of prayer in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places; yet they neuer remembred this calling on Saincts.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2735:61"/>ſhall we thinke then, that the holy Ghoſt did forget or enuy vs a thing (as ye ſay) ſo neceſſary to our ſaluation? we were better to beleeue that this calling on Saincts is not neceſſary. It ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not ſo with Gods commaundementes, as with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, men know one another; men oftentimes in their commandements do ſwarue from reaſon, and from that which may and ſhould be; and therefore their commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be altered, amended, or enlarged: but we may not preſume ſo much on the commaundements of God: the iuſtice and holineſſe of them is aboue vs all: and therefore hath he told vs, that he will be ſerued according to his word, &amp; not after our traditions. why ſeeke we then Angels and Saincts to bring vs to God, ſeing he hath not commaunded it? why ſhould we vſe theſe ceremonies of the Courts of this world; as though we might not haue acceſſe to the King of kings without the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of ſome, whom we ſuppoſe to be highly in his fauour? why ſhould the Pope driue vs into the daunger of idolatrie and diſobedience to Gods worde, vpon a wrong ſuppoſall, that our petitions to God are to be followed like our ſuites to earthly Princes? But it ſufficeth vs, ſay ye, to find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſaincts and Angels pray for vs; and ſeing they pray for vs, it is to be preſumed, that it is not euill done to ſollicite them, to continue in this good office, and to that end to ſhew our thankfulneſſe towards them ſo farre as we are able. Thus being emboldened vpon this preſumption alone, ye will do &amp; know more then is appointed you; ye venture beyond and againſt the commaundements of God; ye adde by your worldly wiſedome and fleſhly reaſons to the wiſedome of God; hazarding rather to be idolaters then be content therewith: this woulde require a longer diſcourſe; notwithſtanding it ſhall ſuffice me at this time to tell you that your wordes would cary ſome ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if we found not in the Scripture any charge giuen vs, not to call on, reuerence, and pray to Saincts and Angels: but we read, how th'Apoſtles and Angels forbad men to direct their prayers to them, to fall on their knees before them. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the Scripture in expreſſe termes inioyneth vs not to call on any other name then that of the Lord, nor to ſeeke any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2735:61"/>but Chriſt. Feare not,

Finally S. Iohn ſaith:

Why ſhould we linger or be loth to repaire to Ieſus Chriſt at our firſt entrance to prayer, ſeing th'Apoſtles teach vs, that we muſt call on none other name but his; that he is our true mediatour; that beſides him there is none other?

               <p>The Pope enioyneth vs to beleeue that there is a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<note place="margin">Whether there is any Purgatorie after or out of this life: and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</note> a place full of fire, where the ſoules of the deceaſed are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to abide in great torment: ſome for ſo many ages, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for ſo many yeeres, according to the number and qualitie of the ſinnes they committed in this world: that praiers, almes, pilgrimages and other deuotions that are made and geuen for thoſe ſoules, doth greatly comfort and refreſh them. Moreouer, he chalengeth to himſelfe power to take ſoules out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at his pleaſure, the iudgements &amp; decrees of God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: the mouth of his preachers, and their bookes are ſtuft with fables feyned to prooue this fiction. But theſe things are come to paſſe to fulfil the propheſie, that Antichriſt ſhould take heede to fables and vanities. If it be true that a fire is in Purgatorie, and ſoules muſt paſſe through the ſame, tarying therein a certaine time to ſuffer the torments of ſpirituall frying for ſatisfaction of their ſinnes: it ſhould then follow that there is no Sauiour; or els the ſatisfaction of our Sauiour God &amp; man is imperfect and of no power. Now ſo it is, that we learne in the Scripture, how Ieſus is the Sauiour; that the father gaue his ſonne to be Sauiour of the world: this is the ſubiect, this is the marke whereat the Prophets aymed; this is the Goſpell, this haue the Apoſtles witneſſed by wordes, writings, miracles and ſufferings: how that we are ranſomed by his death and paſſion; that the purging and remiſſion of our ſinnes is made by his bloud, that the ſatisfaction he hath made for vs is whole &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

On the other ſide, ſeeing Ieſus Chriſt is God, we may not doubt of the perfection of his deedes: and thereupon we know the ſatisfaction he made for vs is complete and performed.

Conclude we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this matter and acknowledge we, that there is no purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie but in the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt; and that preſently after our departure out of this world our ſoules are condemned, or iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt for euermore; and therefore let vs refuſe all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Deceaſed as vaine and vnprofitable, iſſued from the ſhop of Satan, from traditions of men, &amp; not from God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he maketh no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame in the holy Scripture, Let vs be charitable towards the liuing, towards the poore and other miſerable perſons, as God hath commaunded; and not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dead, that haue no need thereof or good thereby, and towards whom God hath not commaunded vs to be charitable. And let vs ſay, that ſeing there is no Purgatorie, we need not diſpute, whether the Pope ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take ſoules out of it, or no: ſo it is, that in the ſame he exalteth himſelfe aboue God, promiſing to deliuer ſoules out of the priſons, hands &amp; power of God: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to make void the iudgements and condemnations, to auoid or deminiſh the paines ordeyned by God: ſuch actions are th'actions of ſuperiors towards their inferiors. We will not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2735:65"/>ſtay to confute many other blaſphemies beſide, which neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the doctrine of Purgatorie; as, that there is a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſinnes elſwhere then in Ieſus Chriſt; that there is ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by another meane then by Chriſt; that man through ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of torments may content the iuſtice of God and deſerue ſaluation. For, ſince Purgatorie is aboliſhed, whatſoeuer depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereon can not ſtand; and ſo are all theſe blaſphemies ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conuinced by the arguments aforeſaid, our ſufferings (ſaith S. Paul) are not worthy of the glory to come.

               <p>The Pope will not haue the Bible to be tranſlated into French our vulgar and mother tong,
<note place="margin">Whether we ought to haue the Bible in the mother tóg.</note> for that (ſaith he) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is too hard, it is of too high meditation to be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the common people: but this is rather to hide the truth, and publiſh and auctoriſe lyes without any gain-ſaying. I well wot, that the holy Scripture in its force and ſignification rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth beyond the power of mans vnderſtanding. But the Pope deceiueth himſelfe greatly, if he ſuppoſeth men to be more or leſſe capable to read, receiue and vnderſtand, according as they are more or leſſe acquainted, and haue proceeded in humane learnings, and worldly affaires. for experience teacheth vs, that the more learned, the more fine-witted, the more cunning, and the greater ones after the world, are leſſe worthy, leſſe able to conceiue, &amp; leſſe called to the knowledge of the ſecret of Gods word. The hiſtorie of the Church ſhoweth, that theſe are the Phariſies, the Doctors &amp; Gloſſers of the law, the Philoſophers &amp; Magiſtrats, that could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue this eaſie difficultie, &amp; this high humilitie &amp; ſimplicitie of the Goſpell: but ſtroue &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues againſt it with force and exceeding furie. it is not the power and abilitie of man that obteineth to man the knowledge and vnderſtanding of the word of God; it is the ſpirite of God working and dwelling in him that doth it, as it is written,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> no man knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God. Now this Spirit hath no reſpect nor maketh accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of perſons; he dwelleth more ordinarily within the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, within litle-ones, within them that are not puft vp with their knowledge, wiſdome, experience and dignitie. ſo doeth Ieſus Chriſt thanke his Father, for that he had declared his Goſpell to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2735:65"/>the little ones, and not to the great after the world:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> ſo ſay th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that the Goſpell, word and wiſdome of God, are foliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and offence to the wiſe of the world:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 26.</note> and ſo was Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted mad by Feſtus the gouernour. We note in all the New teſtament, that they who firſt heard, receiued &amp; kept with more readines &amp; ſtedfaſtnes the word of Ieſus Chriſt, were the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the people, were wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, poore folke, thoſe whom ye call clownes, fiſhers, handicraftes-men, toll-takers, &amp; others of like condition; the Apoſtles &amp; all Ieſus Chriſt his Diſciples welnigh were of that degree: we note likewiſe that the ſimpler ſort of the people were the readieſt to receiue and conceiue the words of th'Apoſtles, the knowledge of the Goſpell, the miſtery, ſecret and ſimplicitie of the faith.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> And ſo doth S. Paul aduertiſe the Corinthians: brethren (ſaith he) ye ſee your calling, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are called: but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and God hath choſen the weake things of the world to confound the mighty things; and vile things of the world and things that are deſpiſed hath God cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould reioyce in his preſence. According hereunto, the ordinary reproch of the perſecutors to Chriſtians was, that they had none except the poore, except women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſimple men without cunning &amp; knowledge, which made profeſſion of the Goſpell. it is written,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7.</note> how the Phariſees ſaid to the officers that durſt not lay hold on Ieſus: doeth any of the Rulers or of the Phariſees beleue in him? but this people, which know not the law, are curſed. The profane hiſtories of the Greekes and Romains are full of ſuch reproches and tawnts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians. Now on th'otherſide, if we conſider the word of God, the whole Bible in it ſelfe, ſetting apart the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings or inlightnings, which come from aboue and accompany Gods calling and election; it will appeare that wee may read nothing more plaine, or eaſie to be conceiued of the vulgar ſort, then the Bible is. The holy hiſtory conteined in moſt part of of the Old teſtament is ſet downe in very popular &amp; common termes, and ſo is the law: the Prophets are ſomewhat hard to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2735:66"/>vnderſtand, but they are difficult to none ſaue thoſe that think by their high wittes to find out their difficulties: for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is like a garden that bringeth foorth fruits for all maner of ſtomachs, the fruites thereof are eaſie enough to be digeſted of them that are content with the firſt and natural ſence of the letter: groſſer witted men, wemen and children can vſe it ſo far forth as to reape profit of it: but withall it hath meditations moſt deepe, moſt high, excelling all other learning by degrees, for the ſharper ſort of wits, and ſuch as feele themſelues aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the like contemplations. As for the Goſpell and Epiſtles of th'Apoſtles, nothing is more eaſie, nor more apt of it ſelfe to be conceiued: if ſome things hard to be vnderſtood be in th'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of S. Paul, it is hard to none but to them that wreſt the ſame and all other Scriptures,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> as S. Peter affirmeth. It is certaine that the holy Scripture, inlightneth it, ſelfe &amp; ſtoupeth low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lowly ſoule; darkneth it ſelfe and mounteth aloft out of ſight before the lofty and preſumptuous ſoule: it is certaine that it frameth it ſelfe to our beginnings and proceedings in knowledge, it ſoreth vpward and waxeth ſubtill, in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as our wits are cleered: each one findeth there his repaſt, and the more he feedeth the greater is his appetite. Finally, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt of all called on the holy Ghoſt as our dutie is, let vs with patience and humilitie vſe ordinary reading of the Bible from the beginning to th'end, and not by gobbets, here a ſnatch and there a ſnatch with no good courage, and rather for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, or ſearch of doubts and controuerſies therein, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct &amp; ſtabliſh our minds; and then euery of vs, great &amp; ſmall, learned &amp; ignorant, rich &amp; poore, men, wemen &amp; children ſhall iudge that no booke is more eaſie to vnderſtand, then the Bible. And in deede, the hiſtory, the law, the Prophets, the Goſpell &amp; th'Epiſtles are no other then ſpeaches, ſermons, familiar letters and aduertiſements of Ieſus Chriſt, of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles to the people of their times, to perſons of all ſorts, &amp; moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to the common ſort onely: thus did our Sauiour preach in villages, and fields, in wilderneſſes, on the ſea ſhore, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the temple: thus did the Prophets proclaime their meſſage on houſe-tops, in ſtreets, in the temple: thus did th'Apoſtles
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2735:66"/>preach, from village to village, from vp-landtowne to vpland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne, from Citie to Citie, indifferently to all. The Goſpell is nothing els but an hiſtorie and report in writing of all theſe preachings; it is the ſpeach of Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſet downe with the pen on parchmine or paper. Now, that which the holy Ghoſt hath iudged eaſie enough for the people, to be pronounced to them by liuely voyce, we may not with reaſon iudge it ouer-hard for the people, to be publiſhed to them by writing, for further ſtay may be made on the wordes written, which abide and as it were tarry for the later thought of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then on the wordes vttered with the liuely voyce, which ſlide away and tary not, nor yet returne. The Iewes haue euer had (vnleſſe captiuitie letted them) the Bible in their moſt vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all language and writing they neuer refuſed to make euery one partakers of the Bible, euen to childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fiue yeare old: at eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yere old they had read the law through-out, and had peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed leafe by leaf the Commentaries of their Rabins or Doctors: the Greekes haue had the New Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in their mother tong, and the Latins in theirs, and likewiſe the Syrians: in ſumme, all Chriſten nations haue had it ech in their moſt common maner of ſpeach &amp; writing. So that they offer iniurie to the common-people of Fraunce to eſteeme them vncapable of reading thoſe bookes, which th'Iſraelits imparted to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fiue years old: they offer iniurie to all French-men vnlatined, to eſteeme them more rude and blockiſh then Syrians, Greekes, Latins and other peoples: nay, which is worſe, they offer iniurie to God, to ſhut vs his booke, to hold his word (as it were) in ward, &amp; keepe his ſecret cloſe;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tob.</hi> 12.</note> it is good (ſaith th'Angell to Tobie) to keepe cloſe the kings ſecret, but it is honorable to reuele the workes of God. Againe, if the Goſpell or glad tidings ought not to haue bene geuen and declared to ech people after their ſeuerall maner of ſpeach and vnderſtanding, if the Goſpell ſhould haue bene declared but in one tongue, to what and then were thoſe manifold tongues giuen to th'Apoſtles? But mark how the Pope hath withholden the keyes of knowledge and hidden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; marke how he hath hidden the way of truth; marke how the Pope hath drawen againe the veile ouer the face of peoples to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2735:67"/>lead them blindfold as him luſt; marke how he hath exalted the mountaines of ignorance and ſuperſtition which Ieſus Chriſt had made low,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſay.</hi> 40.</note> hath made the wayes crooked which our Lord Ieſus had made ſtreight, hath locked vp the gate of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which our Sauiour had opened; marke how the Pope hath deſtroyed the hearing of the truth, folowing that which was foreſhewed of Antichriſt.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> This is that ſuperſtition of tongue which hath fauoured and greatly furthered the Pope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and bring forth his lyes, to bring them vp, &amp; bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in credit, &amp; to father the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the auctoritie, which belongeth onely to the veritie. We muſt beleeue, that if it had bene in the Popes power to cauſe all the bookes of Gods word to be burned, he had done it without doubt, vpon the ſelfe ſame reaſon that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Senate of Rome to burne certeine Greeke books found within the tumbe of Numa Pompilius: for the Senate feared leaſt theſe bookes treating of true wiſedome, would haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed th'abuſes of their Religion, and crakt the credit which the Romain people gaue to it, and thereby ſhrewdly diſioint their ſtate: euen ſo it ſtood the Pope in hand to feare leſt the making of the holy Scripture manifeſt and common, ſhould pull down and bring to naught his doctrine, his auctoritie and ſtate: and and this is the true cauſe why he can abide in no wiſe, but ſtriues with might and mayn againſt publiſhing of the holy Scripture. Then let the bookes be leſt open &amp; in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon language, let them be written that all perſons without exception may ſee &amp; ſearch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Prophets foretold ſhould be in the time vnder Chriſt: let vs vtter and ſhow the Lords ſecret abroad: let vs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther th'accompliſhment of the Propheſie of Ieremie cited by S.

               <p>Now againe,
<note place="margin">Whether we ought to pray, and prayſe God in a tongue which we vnderſtand not.</note> the Pope willeth that Prieſtes, Chanons, Munkes and other officers of the Church ſhall do their Church ſeruices in the Latin tongue, ſhall ſay and ſing Maſſe, Laudes, and Praiers in the Latin tongue, euen in a ſtrange tongue which moſt Frenchmen vnderſtand not. But the Scripture willeth the contrarie.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> The Apoſtle ſaith, that they which ſpeake in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2735:67"/>Church in a ſtrange tongue and vnknowen, are barbarians to them whom they ſpeake to; that they ſpeake in the ayer; that they are vnprofitable; that they ought to holde their peace: if the trumpet (ſaith he) geue an vncertaine ſound, who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to battaile? So likewiſe you, by the tongue, except ye vtter words that haue ſignification, how ſhall it be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode what is ſpoken? If I pray (ſaith th'Apoſtle) in a ſtrange tongue, my ſpirite prayeth, but mine vnderſtanding is without fruict. What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirite, but I will pray with th'underſtanding alſo: els, when thou bleſſeſt with the ſpirite, how ſhall he that occupieth the roome of th'unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſay Amen at thy geuing of thanks, ſeeing he knoweth not what thou ſayeſt: for thou verily geueſt thanks well, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not edified. Theſe words are ſo carefully ſpoken, that no doubt is left, but that we ought to pray, and praiſe God in the Church onely in a tongue which all doo vnderſtand. We finde in Saint Marke and Saint Iames,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.</note> that prayer without faith is vnfruictfull and ſinne before God: and elſewhere,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.</note> that there can be no faith without knowledge. they then that pray in Latine, not vnderſtanding what they pray, pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, for they pray without knowledge:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> and thus their prayer is vnfruictfull, yea it is ſinnefull. Let vs not vnaduiſedly forgo the fruict, which prayer affoordeth them that vſe it as they ought: let vs not marre this meane, nor miſuſe this duety ſo neceſſary to a Chriſtian: and let vs pray, and praiſe God in our knowen and common tongue, with ſpirite, vnderſtanding and faith.</p>
               <p>The Pope forbiddeth marriage to perſons innumerable,
<note place="margin">Whether marriage ought to be forbidden to Prieſts, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen and other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons.</note> men and women, and to them namely that ſerue at the altar, as alſo to them that enter into any religious order: there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God ſo ſtraightly kept as this countermaund of the Pope is. The holy Scripture permitteth marriage to all men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and namely to Sacrificers &amp; Leuites, to prieſts and Biſhops. We finde it written, that to marry is no ſinne, that marriage is honourable among all. After S.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> Paul had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded virginitie, to wit, chaſtitie, which ye terme Celibat,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> or ſingle life; he preſently addeth:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> and this I ſpeake for your owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2735:68"/>not to tangle you in a ſnare; but that ye followe that which is honeſt. In the ſame Chapter he biddeth all perſons to marry, that cannot abſteine; for (ſaith he) it is better to marry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to burne. And againe, to take away all ſcruple, he warranteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, that if he marry he ſinneth not, and euery virgin, that if ſhe marry ſhe ſinneth not.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> And in another place he paſſeth further, not permitting, but bidding young widowes to marrie, that they geue no occaſion to the aduerſarie to ſpeake euil. It is knowen how great cleanneſſe was required in Prieſts &amp; Leuits in the olde Teſtament, and chiefly in the high Prieſt: God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to marry neuertheleſſe, and for their marriage or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned certaine lawes.

In the new Teſtament is written,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> that a Biſhop muſt be vnreproueable, the husbande of one wife, one that can rule his owne houſe honeſtly, hauing children vnder obedience with all honeſtie: for if any cannot rule his owne houſe, how ſhall he care for the Church of God? Theſe later wordes doo plainly confute them that durſt wreſt the former, to wit [the husband of one wife] as if the Apoſtle had meant [the Biſhop muſt be Biſhop of one Church] in which gloſſe is no colour, but euidently corrupteth the text, &amp; is contrary to their owne practiſe: for the place conteyneth a rehearſall of qualities, whereby a man meete to be a Biſhop may be diſcerned from one vnmeete: and among the reſt, this is put as principall, namely, his care and diſcretion to gouerne wel his wife, family and children; for (ſaith th'Apoſtle) if he cannot rule his owne houſe well, how ſhall he care for the Church of God? It is alſo contrary to their own practiſe. For if it be true (as their gloſſe importeth) that a Biſhop muſt be Biſhop of one Church, then are they not Apoſtolike Biſhops, that will be Biſhops of many Churches; much leſſe the Pope, that will be Biſhop of all Churches, better it were then for them to caſt away their gloſe, then change their practiſe. Moreouer, S. Paul admoniſheth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2735:68"/>Titus his diſciple, to ordeine Prieſtes or Elders in euery Citie, as he appointed him, and then he addeth: if any be vnreproua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the husband of one wife, hauing faithfull children, which are not ſlaundered of riot, neither are diſobedient: for a Biſhop muſt be vnreproueable. As for the Apoſtles, that they were married we may not doubt, vnleſſe we wil doubt of the trueth. Haue we not power (ſaith S. Paul) to leade about a wife being a ſiſter, as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas. I will not ſay that it is not good to counſel Prieſts and all other the faithfull to abſteme from marriage ſo long as they ſhall feele that they haue this power ouer themſelues to be able to abſteine,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> ſo long as they finde in themſelues the gifte of chaſtitie: for (as S. Paul aduertiſeth) marriage chargeth man and wife greatly with the cares of this world. But then it were good to keepe our ſelues within termes of counſelling, and not fall to flat forbidding to marrie, and to fortifie it with threatenings of paines corporall &amp; ſpirituall, temporall and perpetuall: it were good to keepe within the bounds of th'Apoſtle, who ſpeaking twiſe or thriſe of chaſtitie, ſheweth that hee ſpeaketh but by counſell, that to enioyne perſons not to marry, were to tangle their conſciences in a ſnare; that the gift of chaſtitie is not in mans power, but commeth from God. Behold then how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmeth, that forbidding of mariage is a marke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſaying: now the ſpirite ſpeaketh euidently,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> that in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times ſome ſhal depart from the faith, forbidding to marry; as it followeth in the text. The boldneſſe is ſtrange, that the Pope durſt attempt to take from men the remedy, which God had geuen them againſt whoredome, leauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to burne in their lewde luſtes, and in adultery and other filthines, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering them to the iudgement &amp; wrath of God.

Not that the matter were hard to proue: for among them that reuerence &amp; read the holy Scriptures, there is no man ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in the ſame, and ſo ſlenderly acquainted with the ſtate of your Church, but can eaſily iuſtifie euery contrarietie. Howbeit, their numbre is ſo great, that the memory, age, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and inſtruments of one man can not ſerue to ſet downe the full reckening of all. But yet, me thinks I haue ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make you know and acknowledge, that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med doo not without reaſon condemne the Pope and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: I haue ſaid enough to inſtruct and cauſe you to confeſſe the Pope to be that great Antichriſt, foretold by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, his Prophets and Apoſtles, and whom they threatened and aſſured vs ſhould come. Ye ſee all the Prophecies touching Antichriſt brought to paſſe in the Pope &amp; by the Pope: which can not be verified in any other perſecutor of the Church what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. The Arabians, Tartars, Scithians and Parthians; the Hunnes, Vandals and ſo many other nations of the North and Eaſt; Attila, Mahumet, Tamberlan, and the Turks the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Mahumet haue mightily perſecuted, and yet do perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Goſpell: but many Antichriſts were to come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeuerall propheſies apart by themſelues.
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 15.</note> Hereupon is it ſayd that the Eaſt in the end of the world ſhall bring many miſeries: theſe be the Dragons of Arabia; the cloudes comming from the Eaſt and North, ful of wrath and ſtorme, which ſhould cauſe ſo great fearfulnes and trembling, and ſpil ſo much bloud, as in Eſdras is fore-ſhewed. Let it ſuffice you, that Attila, Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met and all their ſucceſſours with the Monarchs and peoples
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2735:70"/>aforenamed came not out of the fourth Monarchy, as the Pope did:

They were neither borne within the Church nor yet went out of it: for they neuer had entered into it. But Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was to be borne in the Church,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 13. <hi>Dan</hi> 9. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.</note> was there to abide and reigne according to the propheſies of Ieſus Chriſt, of Daniel, S. Paul, S. Peter, and S. Iohn. The Pope was borne there, went out from thence, &amp; yet abideth &amp; reigneth there with great power, pompe, and tyranny. The firſt weapons of Antichriſt ſhould be ſeducings and ſpirituall poyſonings, as the Apocalyps war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, vnder the name of the Whore and hir enticements: which can not he applied to them, that planted their falſe religion and performed all by fire, ſword, and furie. But the Pope hath layd the ground-worke and mayn-ſtay of his firſt and principall greatnes and power, on will-worſhips, on the ſhow of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit holineſſe, on falſe miracles, ſeducing and bewitching peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and nations with words and deeds well pleaſing fleſh and bloud, as alſo with promiſſes and preſents of goods and honors. Other ring leaders of hereſie, as Arrius, Maniche, Pelagius, and ſuch like, reigned not, as Antichriſt was to reigne, in the temple of God with all exceſſe of power and glory; they neuer exalted themſelues aboue kings, aboue all which is called God; their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducings and oppreſſions were neuer ſo generall and continuall, as the great Antichriſt ſhould bring to paſſe. Take the paine your ſelfe, for you ought, it is as much as your ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is worth, to conſider more heedfully the propheſies of Antichriſt, and compare the Goſpell, with that which they teach and practiſe in your Church: &amp; ye will find that I tarry not on euery poinct, but do ouerpaſſe farre moe matters then I touch. your ghoſtly Fathers and Doctors, like very Phariſees and hypocrites as they be for the moſt part, do ſet vp againſt all theſe truths, the defenſe of the Phariſees againſt Ieſus Chriſt. How can it be, ſay your Doctors, that ſo many holy fathers, ſo many learned clerkes, ſo many men, ſo many peoples and countries haue conſented to the doctrine of the Pope for ſo many hundred yeares, if it were againſt God, and againſt Holy-writ, ſpecially ſeing our Sauiour hath ſaid: behold, I am with you vntill the end of the world?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2735:70"/>This defenſe pleaſeth fleſh and bloud paſſing well: the fleſh fancieth them too well, who teach, that it is not ordinary for a man to wander out of the way, to ſinne, and to go on in his wandring and ſinne. Vnder the warrant of this defence infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſoules doo ſtay, waxe ſluggiſh, and are luld aſleepe, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at ſuch as would wake them out of this drouſie diſeaſe. But the wiſedome of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> and the naturall man perceyueth not the things of the ſpirit of God, ſaith Sainct Paul; fleſh and bloud are blind and can not diſcerne theſe myſteries: then let vs not conſult herein with worldly wiſedome, or with fleſh and bloud, but with the ſpirite of God. By this ſpirite in the holy hiſtorie wee are taught, that Adam after his fall by ſinne was ſomewhat relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and reformed by the Lord, that God by his Angels viſibly did warne him and his children from time to tyme to walk and liue according to his commaundements, with promiſe to reſtore and repaire the decay of mankind: notwithſtanding, in leſſe then two or three generations they forſooke the voyce and way of God, and were corrupted after the imaginations and deuiſes of the fleſh; and this corruption laſted aboue ſixteen hundred yeares. Then the mercyfull Lord willing to ſhew his fauour towardes mankind, repayred his Church, renewed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements to Noë and his children: but againe, within leſſe then foure generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the people went aſtray, &amp; forgat God &amp; his commaundements. A long time after that going aſtray, the Lord called Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; reſtored his Church by him, leauing the reſt of all mankind in their corruption, who remained therein till the comming of Chriſt, for two thouſand yeares and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The holy Ghoſt mereouer teacheth, how after the Church was reſtored in Abraham, &amp; confirmed in Moſes and in all the children of Iſraëll, there folowed many reuoltes in the Church of Iſraël, euen as generall as the former aboue rehearſed, for they ſeemed all to haue forſaken the right way, inſomuch as the faithfull appeared no-where: theſe apoſtaſies or backſlidings endured, ſome for two hundred yeares, ſome more, ſome leſſe, though the Lord in the meane while awaked them and called them againe by his Prophets. Ye know further how the Greeks
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2735:71"/>for the moſt part ſwarued, ye count them for heretikes or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in maner al. Now ſo it is; that th'Iſraëlites and Greekes may as well, or better then you, preuaile with theſe wordes of Chriſt, [I will be with you vntill the end of the world] for as large and more expreſſe promiſes then that, had bene made to th'Iraëlits: and this promiſe pertained as well to the Greekes as to you: becauſe they were inſtructed in the Goſpell before ye were, and that more carefully and by mo Apoſtles then ye were: and yet for all this both th'Iſraëlites &amp; Greeks are gone aſtray from the faith theſe many hundred yeares paſt; which alſo hath befallen the Churches of Affrik, who may chalenge to themſelues th'aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of thoſe promiſes with as great reaſon, as you may. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, your owne Churches haue bene defiled and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growé with hereſies, namely when the barbarous nations of the North, and enemies of our faith left no face of a Church almoſt throughout Europe. We muſt acknowledge therefore, that ſuch promiſes of God do neuer paſſe without this condition, if ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in me; in th'obedience of my word, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Moſes.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2735:71"/>&amp; ſayings that vniuerſall &amp; long-laſting corruptions &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoltes are ordinary in the Church; that when the Church forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word of God, then God withdraweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her his holy ſpirit, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her his holy ſpirit, the more ſhe haſteth forward, the further ſhe wandreth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right path, &amp; the more encreaſeth her corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that in her ſelfe no meane may be found to repaire her ruines, or returne her into the right way, if the Lord takes her not by the had &amp; guides her aright to the forſaken way by his ſpirit &amp; word. We learne alſo, that after the Lord hath lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men the time of their corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ignorance, he hath geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to the vanitie of their minds, which boaſt &amp; braue it with the bare titles of his Church &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: renewing his Church in the meane ſeaſon neuertheleſſe in miraculous ſort by his immediat and extraordinary callings, as thoſe of Noë, Abraham, Moſes, Ezechias, Ioſias and others.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2735:72"/>I wil ſay by the way that cleare-ſighted perſons can quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that the decrees and diuers doctrines of your Church are for the moſt part founded vpon gayne. In ſumme, ſith ye haue deſpiſed the waters of Siloë, marueil not that ye are fallen and welnigh drowned in the floud and bottomleſſe gulfe of mens traditions: ye haue left the piller and prop of the Lord; your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie is like a ſwelling in an high wall, whoſe breaking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſodainly, ye haue ſet naught by the hallowed fire of God, to ſeek out another of your own kindling, marueil not that ye walke not in the light but ſtumble in the darke: and ſith ye draw nigh to the deuill, and draw backe from God, marueil not that the deuill drawes nigh to you, and God drawes backe from you. Finally, for that ye haue abuſed Gods promiſſes, preſuming to take him at his word without caring for the condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he gaue his word, and thinking him tied by his promiſe to be with you, and you not bound by the condition to obey him, therefore hath that preſumption entangled your ſoules within the cordes of vanitie, and hampred you in thoſe iniquities and curſes which we daily ſee. But all theſe inducements and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are yet too low for matters ſo high. The ſecret cauſe of th'eſtrangings from God, of your reuolts of the Church are paſt the reach of mans reaſon, it is the bottomleſſe ſea of Gods counſell; and therefore muſt bee treated of in another ſort. Why ſhould wee aske how it may come to paſſe, which wee ſee is come to paſſe? why ſhould we aske, how it could be, that the Church loſt her way ſo long time, ſince our Lord, the Prophets and Apoſtles aſſured vs that ſo it ſhould be? ſuch queſtioning doth vtter the miſtruſt of Gods propheſies lurking in our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing hearts.

It is written in S. Peter: there ſhalbe falſe teachers among you,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> which priuely ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, euen denying the Lord,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.</note> that hath bought them: and in S. Iohn; as ye haue heard that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall come, euen now (ſaith he) are there many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts. Leaue then to demaunde how that may come to paſſe, which ye ſee is come to paſſe, and which is agreeable to mans naturall corruption, &amp; to the ordinary conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, and which muſt needes come to paſſe, as the Prophecies muſt needes be true. But iudge now, if it be graunted you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, whether we liue in the time of all theſe prophecies, or no. See whether the branch of the fig-tree is tender, and the leaues come forth. Weigh whether ye breathe out any words but the words
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2735:74"/>of men, who ſeeke the ranſome of your ſoules elſwhere than in Chriſt, who are not learned nor deuout but in your fanſies and deſires: for your munkeries, doctrines and deuotions are onely founded on the deſire of man. iudge whether ye that enioy this world at pleaſure, &amp; do perſecute, are of the crue of Antichriſt; or els the Reformed whom ye pill, ſpoyle and ſacke, whom ye caſt out of their houſes, whom ye chaſe out of the world, who ſuffer at your hands endleſſe vexation, and who breathe out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the word of God. My children, let vs do as Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Ioſias and other good kings of Iſrael did: when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet the Church in order, they ouerskipped all mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions receiued and practized in the Church, and ſearched out the word of God, that lay before buried in darkenes; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that word alone reformed the Church: let vs looke back on the ſtone from whence we were cut of; let vs bring our mother back to her former husband; let vs returne together to the water of Siloe, to wit, Ieſus Chriſt and his word. Saint Iohn biddeth vs not to ſtand faſt in the traditions and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we ſhall finde in the Church, but in that which we haue heard from the beginning: that which we haue heard from the beginning is the word of God. Let vs hie faſt and ſtand to it: preſcription of time or contrary cuſtome cannot abate one iote of th'auctoritie, trueth and power thereof; it cannot deceiue vs; we ſhall neuer want excuſe before God, if we rule our ſelues by it; for by this onely rule hath he commaunded vs to ſerue him, and hath forbidden vs to adde thereto, or take ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fro. Now ſo it is, that to the ſame word the Reformed ſubmit and order themſelues in their deuotions and actions, ſomuch as they are able. Then let vs freely conclude the appearance to be greater that ye are th'heretikes and ſchiſmatikes, rather then they. They may tell you, as Elias tolde Achab: we are not they that trouble Iſrael, that trouble the Church; but ye and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, which haue forſaken the commandements of God and followed Baalim, Antichriſt, mens commaundements and traditions, fables, lies and vanities: but aboue all, the ſchiſme which you would caſt on them, reboundeth on your ſelues: for this is a ruled caſe, that he which ſeperateth himſelfe is not the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2735:74"/>ſchiſmatike, but he onely that geues the occaſion. And that is your corruption &amp; your confuſion, which occaſioneth them to ſeuer themſelues from you: withall, your ſeducings, and chiefly your perſecutions be ſo great, that they cannot endure to tarry with you.

And yet although they deteſt &amp; flie your errors, they are willing neuertheleſſe to tarry by you and among you, to bring you by the word of God, to the trueth of the word of God: they are ready to preach in your Churches, if ye will.

They are no longer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2735:75"/>to whom ye deny the intereſt and benefit of the law of all nations vnder heauen, to whom ye haue vnrighteouſly violated your faith, whom ye perſecute in their goods &amp; perſons, whom ye compell againſt their conſciences, whom ye put to death: they are the people of God, the true profeſſors of his holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. They be no heretiks, though ye aſſay by violence to bring them backe into the right way, as ye ſay: they be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, whom ye ſeeke to bring out of the right way. They are no heretikes, whoſe company and gouernement ye ſeeke to ſhunne, with ſo coſtly an aduenture, as your countrey liues and ſoules are worth: they are Goſpellers (though ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely deride the name) and hold a right opinion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; who demaunde nothing but reaſon and right, euen for the comfort, quiet, profit and ſaluation of all, and cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. It comes to my remembrance, that about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this diſcourſe, when I ſhewed you how needfull it was that othes ſhould be made and kept, and told you how it was impoſſible to excuſe you of periurie and reproofe before God and men after ye had violated the pacifications of this Realme ſo ſolemnely ſworne; I promiſed you then to reſolue you of a doubt which ye might make, to wit, that ſince the breach of the peace ye haue made many others and proteſtations againſt that peace, ſo that by the ſame neceſſary &amp; religious regard of oths, it ſeemeth impoſſible to you to returne againe to obſerue the peace broken. Behold a doubtfull knot, which may be loſed with very ſmall ado. For ſince it appeareth, that the Reformed are true Chriſtians, and do demaunde onely the free and open paſſage of Gods word, that the kingdome of Chriſt may reigne in mens hearts, ye muſt confeſſe that your othes and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made before or after the peace, to hinder the exerciſe of their Religion and deſtroy them, are quite contrary to iuſtice, to Gods glory, the freedome of his word, and the kingdome of his ſonne: ſo that theſe later othes and their like, &amp; not thoſe which you made for preſeruing of peace, are to be condemned and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly retected. It ſtandeth not ſo with vowes &amp; othes which are thought to be made to God, as it doth with teſtaments &amp; ſome other actes among men whereof the later do make the former
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2735:75"/>voyde: for euen as God is vnmoueable and neuer chaungeth his will, euen ſo his pleaſure is, that what ſoeuer is done with him, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promiſe him ſhould be vnmoueable: a vow or othe then being forcibly and lawfully made, all other othes, execrations, and proteſtations which can be made in preiudice of the ſame may not nor ought be counted as othes but as periuries and mere vngodlineſſe. It is a monſtrous abuſe and profaning of faith to make it a warrant for trecherie impietie, trouble, confuſion, and ruine of a ſtate and Church. This is but to ſtrengthen ſinne with ſinne, to eſtabliſh and make faithleſneſſe neceſſary by othes, and namely by othes that can not otherwiſe ſtand nor be auowed before Gods iuſtice. Away then with theſe laſt oths and their like, ſhew your diſalowance of them by your repentance: otherwiſe (to returne to my purpoſe) ye muſt confeſſe that ye will reteine them in deſpite of God and his Church, of reaſon, of iuſtice, of the weale publik, &amp; in the end of your ſelues. Now ſith the caſe ſo ſtands, I tell you not that the Reformed are more in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber &amp; value, that they haue Cities not to be won by aſſault, that they haue ſocieties, amities, alliances, &amp; ayde within &amp; without the Realme: but I tell you, that they haue many mo millions of Angels for them, that the truth of God is vnvanquiſhable, that God is for them, that God ſhalbe the maiſter, that the lambe ſhal ouercome, that his holy Word &amp; Choſen ſhall remaine, and the traditions of men, men them ſelues, and the world ſhall periſh: I tell you, that the people of God, as Iſay ſaith, how few ſoeuer they be,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, his fury burneth, and is too heauie to beare; his lips are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with indignation, and his tongue is like a deuouring fire: his iudgement commeth on you, ſmal time and occaſion is left you to repent. In ſteade of continuing your raging perſecutions, do as S. Paul did:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9.</note> he had receiued a commiſſion to deſtroy the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that were at Damaſcus; he armed himſelfe, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with armed and violent men: he iourneyed to performe his enterpriſe; and lo, he commeth to Damaſcus to ſearch the faithfull out, not to perſecute, but to loue them, to conferre and be inſtructed with them, being inflamed with loue towardes that doctrine, that had afore inflamed him with hatred towards them. And thus ſeeke ye the death and deſtruction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed no longer, ſhun not their company any more, but ſeeke them forth, and draw nigh to them, that ye may liue and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with them in the puritie of the Goſpell. ye perſecute the ſelfe ſame Chriſt, the ſelfe ſame Goſpel which S. Paul did; and ſo may ye be called, as he was, if ye be of Gods choſen. And ſeeing it is not the pleaſure of God to geue our king a ſonne, in ſteade of raging as hetherto ye haue done, becauſe the Princes nigheſt the crowne are Reformed, are Goſpellers: reioyce ye, hoping that peraduenture God will vſe this meane to aduaunce the kingdome of his word. And be not afraide for that ſome Princes are wont to bring fire, ſword, and the halter, to inlarge their religion and make it preuaile: for if they would do ſo, they ſhould hurt their religion, they ſhould ſinne againſt God and his word, according to which onely they rule their zele. The word forbiddeth them, as heretofore we largely declared, to employ violence on the conſciences: the word teacheth them, that it is ſtrong inough to bring to God thoſe that perteine to his election: that the kingdome and conqueſt of conſciences is reſerued to the word and the holy Ghoſt, and not to carnall weapons: that the duetie of men herein, is to inuite men to God mildly by preachings and admonitions; by examples of good life and gentle behauiour, and leaue the reſt to the holy Ghoſt. They know it not but too well, what a diſpleaſure it is to any to haue his conſcience compelled, and that ſuch compulſion is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2735:77"/>vnprofitable, yea, bringeth forth effects cleane contrary to their hope that vſe it. For this cauſe, in the lands vnder their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in their armies, in their houſes, they let their Subiects and ſeruants liue in libertie of their conſciences and exerciſe of their religion, and doo receiue indifferently both the one and the other, the Catholike and Reformed, making vertue the onely difference, wherby they chuſe or refuſe. Againe, why ſhoulde you feare to be hardly vſed by them, that are your naturall and lawfull Princes? hee that commeth to any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion lawfully, dooth alway ſet before his eves in his enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the preſeruation of that which he lawfully enioyeth, yee know the goodneſſe of their nature euen in warre: the truth of their deſerts hath bene ſo great and mighty, as hath forced their very enemies to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it, &amp; which is more, to make it knowen to the world. Aduerſitie is the true ſcholemaiſter of vertue: nothing in this world teacheth a man better how to vſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knowledge &amp; experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: ye know how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time they haue bin vnder this maſter; ye know by their actions, by the voice of the people, by the witnes of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, how much they haue profited in this diſcipline and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the king of Nauarre. I may ſpeake it with th'acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your conſciences, with the truth, that he excelleth in all the parts required in a good Prince the choyſe and wiſhes of men. He beareth ſo prince-like a port in his perſon, and is ſo praiſe-worthy in his actions, as any man liuing. He reigneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe and his ſubiects after an heauenly maner, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly repleniſhed with the Diuine ſpirit, and not after the ordinary maner of men. There is the wit, that is the moſt quick and liuely, moſt ſtayed and ſtedfaſt, that may be deſired: a wit whoſe libertie was neuer enthralled by any cauſe of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor yet grauelled by any ſoudaine chaunce or diſpleaſure that might happen. He hath alwaies ſurmounted accidents of greateſt difficultie and higheſt enterpriſe. His reaſon comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his conceipt with ſuch power, and filleth his mind ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that no place is left for vnbrideled affection, to enter or abide. Neuer was there man of his eſtate, ſo like himſelfe at all times, as he is. He is a great warrier, if euer were any; in all the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2735:77"/>toyles of warfare, he taketh ſuch part, as the ſouldier doeth, not differing in anything from his men of armes, but in matchleſſe conduct and worthineſſe; he is wary and happy in warre, and, if it may be ſpoken, he is worthy of his good hap: neuer Prince being ſo vnwilling to warre as he, hath done ſo many exploicts of warre, as he. The ſtrength of man bringeth no ſuch wonders to paſſe, but the reaſon, experience and iudgement of men that betake their ſoule to the counſaile and gouernement of Gods good ſpirit. He mindeth his affaires; he will ſee, heare &amp; know all: which bringeth to his ſubiects exceeding comfort, and is the onely or moſt ſure meane to continue his officers in their dutie. He is popular, courteous in ſpeach, mild in maners, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in heart: and yet no Prince hath more maieſtie, or whoſe preſence is more awfull, or whoſe auctority conteyneth euery one better in his dutie, or who preſerueth iuſtice more carefully then he, to the well-liking of all. He knoweth not cruelty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, prodigall waſt and oppreſſion, being thing quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his ſtudies and purpoſes: it was ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Thus, it is not the king of Nauarre that ye ſhould complaine of, it is the warre, it is the auctours of theſe warres, which he began not, but rather is wonderfully diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that it endeth not; he neither demaundeth nor purpoſeth to haue good or reſt for himſelf, but with the good and reſt of you all. He can well enough abſteine from the fauours of your Court, he could forthwith finde in his heart to renounce your Crowne, if there went with it nothing ſaue his owne, but there goeth with it more of yours, then of his; there goeth away with it of your goods &amp; lands, your honour &amp; dignities, your name and credit, your life and libertie, libertie I ſay, which hath euer bene to all men a benefit ineſtimable, but aboue them all to your aunceſtours: ſo that his dutie and degree, his calling and the good will he beareth you, permit him not to forſake and leaue you to the perill wherein ye are; and therefore he either will ſaue you from deſtruction and bondage, or will periſh for you, or will periſh with you. open your eyes then; accept of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2735:78"/>the right, the deſert, &amp; good meaning of the Prince: &amp; beware ye refuſe not ſuch a Prince. Prepare your ſchues to receiue him in the degree and qualitie wherein God doth and will (I hope) offer him to you, not that ye ſhould deſire the deceaſe of your king whom ye haue at this preſent and is blaced ouer you by God. Turne your eyes toward the king of Nauarre with a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard, ſeing he is ſuch a one, that if leaue were graunted you to looke for a king according to your owne choiſe and wiſh, ye could not chuſe nor wiſh one more worthy: Beleeue me, ye ſhall receaue more profit, commoditie, and content by his reigne, then he ſhall: he may better forge ſuch ſubiects, then ye may ſuch a Prince. Ceaſe then your conſpiracies againſt him; nay ceaſe to conſpire againſt your owne ſelues, againſt God himſelfe. It is high time for you to leaue to looke, deſire, and ſeeke for ſtrangers, yet at the laſt call to minde that frank and true heart of your anceſtours, wherewith they bought their owne libertie and yours ſo dearely, freed themſelues from the ſubiection of ſtraungers ſo valiantly, and recouered their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Engliſh ſo nobly. They not onely hated the rule of forreine kings; but alſo would not be ruled by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall kings after a forrein maner. Charlemaine was borne king of Fraunce, he deſcrued and obteined th'Empire; he would haue gouerned this Realme with th'Impetiall lawes, and haue enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fraunce within th'Empire: your forefathers, as Frenchmen in deede, iuſtly ielous of their name, franchiſe, and libertie, could not abide it, and though he was one of the moſt redoubted kings that euer were, yet they ſtood againſt it moſt freely. One of my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtept vp boldly and vſed ſuch ſpeaches to th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charlemaigne their king in the middes of his army. As thou appointeſt vs, ô ſacred Mareſhe, we will folow thine enſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes in what part ſoeuer they are borne, for there is no mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nor thing ſo fearfull that can keepe vs back. Thou beganſt at Rome to be Emperour of other nations; but thou art borne Prince and King of the Frenchmen, whoſe valiance, I wot not with what deſtiny al ſtrangers do enuie, thinking our freedome to be the cauſe of their ſeruitude, although that before thy reign not one onely part of the land could call it ſelfe free. Thou haſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2735:79"/>power to giue the Hungarians a king; the Greekes demaund of thee but amitie; thou commaundeſt in all Europe: for the feare that Aſtrike hath of thee, &amp; the alliance thou haſt in Aſia, thou holdeſt all the earth in peace, &amp; men in ſafety. Thou cauſeſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be obſerued. And yet thou vndertakeſt one care, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the world may be troubled. We that are Frenchmen, though we ſee thee ſo great, demaund nothing of thee but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as afore. If thou employeſt vs not in thy warres, we ſhall thinke our ſelues aboue all others moſt vnhappy &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wilt thou, that thy ſouldiers, thy realme &amp; thy Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhould fall into the ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of th'Empire? O French me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are ye baſtards are ye degenerated? are ye chaungelings? what? haue ye not one ſparke left of this braue and couragious ielouſie of your Anceſtors? is there leſſe heart in you, then was in the Burguinions, that reiected the rule of Conrad th'Emperour, for this onely cauſe, that he was a ſtranger to them? Frenchmen! ſince when came ye out of kinde, to become cowards and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? ye ſell one another; ye ſell your ſelues; ye ſell me alſo. Doubtleſſe ye wil conſume in theſe warres the price of my ſale, and with it whatſoeuer ye haue els, and in th'end, if your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be ſo great, as to deliuer your ſelues and me alſo to the Buyer, ye muſt afterward repay to him that which he gaue you; and whatſoeuer pouertie ye alleage, yet muſt ye reſtore to him the price of my ſale with exceſſiue vſury beſides, and yee muſt disburſe all the charges. Ye ſeeke the ruledome of ſtraungers; if ye be ſo wretched as to find it, ye ſhall know what a ſtraunger may, and is woont to do in a countrie wonne by conqueſt: he will not vnderſtand your language, he will not heare your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; in fine deuouring fire to your deſtruction will come from him. Determine to reſigne the honour of gouernments &amp; iudgements, to yeeld your triumphant ſwords and ſtately robes to ſtraungers. Determine to loute vnder the Lordly looke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the threatnings and ſtripes of the cruell Spaniard. Beginne by times to harden your tender hands with all toyles, handy-crafts, and day-labour: determine to deliuer all the fruicts of your lands and hands into the grype of the greedy Spaniard, &amp; then to wayt without daring to open your mouth till he takes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2735:79"/>pitie on you, &amp; ſhares you out a poore pittance to liue by Leaue to ſtraungers the ancient ſeat, the commodious ſite and ſtately building of your caſtles, gotten with ſo great trauaile, poſſeſſed with ſo great honour and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation, ſtored and enriched with ſtories, armes, and ſtatues of your worthy ſorefathers. Dreame no longer of degree, of place, of nobilitie. Take ye the carke and care of houſekeping, and leaue the profite and pleaſure to them. Stoupe like drudges, and giue account to them like vnderlings of your day-works with trembling at their ſterne lookes, and enduring their maiſter full demeanour. Abandon your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feeres, your deere and delicate daughters to ferue and pleaſe them in all their abhominable luſts. Let your ſonnes be pages and lackeyes to ſterne and lord-like ſtrangers. None ſhalbe ſeen within your houſes, caſtles, palaces, and townes, within the Courts of Princes, and courts of Iuſtice (if any iuſtice be) but ſtrangers: they will carie all the ſwinge, and then Iacke wilbe a Gentleman if he can ſpeake Spaniſh. Think not, that the Courts Royall and thoſe of Iuſtice will haue any other ſpeech, but how to keepe you vnder, to vexe and torment you more and more, to ouer-burden you with new taskes and tallages: and though ye be fleeſed and flayed, yet if ye venture to come neere them to complaine, ye ſhalbe ſet backe with ſtore of blowes. It were a follie to hope that all theſe miſeries, yea worſe then theſe ſhall not fall on your heads. Such curſes &amp; ſcourges of God ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not eſcape; in caſes like to theſe, they are ordinary and vnauoidable, yet further, the Lord will lay his hand on you more heauily by oddes, then on them which caried away through impatience alone, ſeeke the Rule of ſtrangers. Becauſe the hatred you beare to him and to the puritie of his word and Goſpel, pricks you on to runne after ſtrangers. The Lords of the houſes of Loraine &amp; of Guiſe trim you vp this banqueting diſh, and lay before you this poyſoned bait, they are the brokers of theſe your miſeries: neuertheles ye ſay, they beare a marueilous louing hart towards me and towards you, and are honeſt and vertuous. Beleeue me; they loue you, like ſtrangers as they are; that is, for profit and aduancement that they hope to reape of you. Their vnpacified malice, their vnſatisfied auarice, and gaping ambition is that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2735:80"/>which they purſue, and not your cauſe, quiet, contentment, and profit. This is the truth of their commodities, which they only ſeeke vnder the name, viſour, and lying counterfeit of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. For what are their propoſitions, but vaine ſhewes and empty ſhadowes? If they haue bene well affectioned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly minded towards you, they haue fairely left them both: whatſoeuer good affection or minde they had, it gaue vp the ghoſt at leaſt when this goodly enterpriſe of the league began. If it be not permitted them from aboue to ſhew no other kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then hitherto they haue done, God ſaue me &amp; mine from it, and graunt by his grace that the feare may iſſue from you, and deuour them. Come on let vs teach them that the noble hart of Frenchmen is not quayled, nor the ielouſie of their name quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that the loue, charitie &amp; zele of Frenchmen towards their countrie and Princes, are not yet vaniſhed away. Let vs teach them, that ſuch a realme as this can not be ſold, nor payd for: that that is not ſurely bought of ſome particular perſons, which belongeth to ſo many braue, couragious and valiant Princes, Lords and Gentlemen; to ſo many wiſe perſonages, to ſo many good and faithfull ſubiects. If ye do it not, God will do it, and his fury will deuoure you with them, if ye continue in their curſed enterpriſes with them. Be not like to violent flouds, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe to carle, weare, and breake away, till they haue ſpent all their water, and be quite dried vp. When your power ſhalbe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſpent, or ſeized on by others, then your courage ſhall nothing auaile, but to encreaſe your ſorrowes and troubles. Seeke the phyſitian, take counſell, and follow it while loue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat remayneth in you; while there is ſome hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery from your malady long time hath the Lord come to you to ſeeke for fruit, and findeth it not, and yet he tarrieth, digging the ground round about your root and dunging it: long time hath he tarried for your conuerſion, warning you by his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meſſengers the peſtilence, warre, and famine. Doo not abuſe his long-ſufferance. For if he ſpeaketh the word once, his wrath ſhall come, and in a moment ſhall deſtroy you: he hath not yet pronounced it, but hath conceiued it; he openeth his mouth to prononnce it: make haſt then to amend your ſelues. I ſee no
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2735:80"/>way but one for you to recouer your health ſo far out of courſe, by which ye may returne to God. And that way is, ſpeedily to reenter and each of you to keepe himſelfe within the boundes of his calling, opening your cares &amp; ſoules to the word of God with zele &amp; liberty: and whatſoeuer is beſides, leaue it to God, to nature and the law (his ordinary meanes) touching the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the crowne: ſeyng that which ye now do &amp; attempt, is againſt God, and bringeth the Church, the Realme, the King and his ſubiects to wracke and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Ye then, my Clergi-men,
<note place="margin">Admonition, to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</note> who are ſaid to be the firebrandes of this ciuil flame, who are as hote as the ouen, and cate vp the Iudges, returne vnfeinedly to the care of ſpirituall things; let your diligence and ſtudie be conteyned within the Churches, within the margines of the holy Bible: the care of the Crowne is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to you. Ye feare (as ye ſay) a change in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: this is a colour without matter ye ſhalbe warranted from all changes, except thoſe that the word of God ſhall make. If ſuch changes befall, they ſhalbe agreeable to you, ye ſhall be the firſt that will conſent to them: they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, nor ought to be hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you, vnleſſe ye reſemble the Gadarenits,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.</note> who eſteemed their ſwine more than the Goſpell, and thinking to ſaue their ſwine, droue Chriſt away. Now, the feare that ye haue to loſe your worldly commodities, ought not to make you continue in theſe your reſolutions ſo pernitious. For ye ſhalbe inexcuſable before God, as hath bene ſaid. On the other ſide, your feare is vaine: none can, none ought, none will attempt to touch you in your perſons, dignities, goods, franchiſes and liberties. But mark how ye fall into th'inconueniences which ye flie, and thinke to preuent or auoide with vaine feare and falſe alarme ye are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of your fall in vaine by this feare ye further your fall in effect. How much haue ye disburſed? how much haue ye loſt to auoide th'effects of this feare? your moſt ſworne foes would haue bene ſatisfied with the hundreth part thereof: ye might with it haue bought peace of a very Turke: and yet ye are but in the beginning; ye are neuer the neere to the end; ye haue more to do, and more to feare, than at the firſt ye had. Marke how three or foure of the greateſt of your eſtate and calling giue you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2735:81"/>this falſe alarme, to make ye run to armes, or to your purſes, to helpe them: they put you in conceipt of ſicknes, to make you be let bloud, becauſe they haue to do with your bloud. They make you loſe and waſt away your conſciences, your ſoules, your wits, your bodies and your goods, in purſuite of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and particular quarels. He needes not complaine, that may come out of his miſeries and wil not: ye may haue peace &amp; quiet if ye liſt; ye haue no paine, loſſe, nor griefe, but that which ye bring on your ſelues. Holde your ſelues content with th'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of your functions and eſtates, with th'enioyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of your houſes, priuiledges and franchiſes, with the receiuing of your rights: there is none that demaundes any thing of you: aſſurance ſhalbe gĕuen with othe ſo farre as ſhalbe needfull, that none ſhall meddle with you, or any thing that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth you. But ye neede no greater aſſurance than this, to wit, the religion of your reputed enemies is quite contrary to that, which ye feare at their handes, namely, to be forced by them. Forbeare then to ſet this Realme on fire; forbeare theſe commotions contrary to your vocation, forbidden of God to all perſons, and ſpecially to you. Leaue the diſpoſing of the Crowne to him, whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to diſpoſe, to your ſoueraigne God and his ordinarie meanes, to nature and the law.</p>
               <p>And you my Nobles,
<note place="margin">To the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</note> why are ye come out of the franchiſe and libertie of your anceſtors, to become ſeruants and penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſtrangers, to take pay and penſion of the League? what meane ye to do? meane ye to ſet the Crowne on the head of the Lorraine or Spaniard? That cannot be, your Princes haue God, reaſon and right on their ſides: and ſo neither frendes nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſucceſſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faile them in theſe affaires. All that ye can do (ſo farre as the witte of man can foreſee) is but to prepare an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting warre in this Realme, ruinous to you &amp; yours while the world endureth. For there be branches inow ſhooting out of the ſtockes of your Princes, there is courage and force mough on their part, to mainteine the warre for euer. The moſt and the worſt ye may doo, is to aide the Lorraines and Spaniardes to ouer-turne this ſtate on them, on you, and on your brethren. I can ſee no other good comming to you by your league, your
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2735:81"/>conſpiracie, and ſubuerſion of this ſtate. When the Princes ſhal be brought to ruine, the curſe of the Aegyptians, rehearſed by Iſay, abideth you: euery one ſhall make battaile againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; euery one againſt his friend; Citie againſt Citie. The Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians that ſhall remaine, will run one at the other like Rammes in rutting time; the gouernors wil thinke to get th'vpper hand; ſo many gouernors, ſo many butchers and peti-tyrannes: thus ſhall you continue ſtill betwixt the hammer and the anuill. For if your Countrey (as God forfend) ſhould become a pray for ſo many catchers, doo ye not ſee alredy in what plight your ſelues ſhall ſtand betwene them? Thinke ye to be more honoured, or mainteined in your glorious titles by ſtrangers, enuying your glory &amp; greatnes, than by Frenchmen that part-take as brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſhining beames of your renown? Feare ye to be worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in religion and other cauſes, by your naturall Princes, that cannot ſee you ſuffer, but they ſuffer alſo with you, by force of the naturall compaſſion that ſhould be betweene you, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame body, then by ſtrangers, whoſe natural proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to reioyce in your greeuances, according to the naturall grudge betwene you and them? Feare ye to be worſe intreated in religion, of your owne Countreymen, who haue ſtil required to haue the conqueſt of conſciences left to God and his word; than of ſtrangers, who haue ſtill made religion plie and bow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their appetites, to ſerue them for a cloke in th'execution of their enmities, ambition and couetiſe: the liking of your digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, your wiues and houſes, ſhall condemne you of hereſie. Set before your eyes a mad bedlem body, trotting in and out, and carrying with toyle and much adoo, fewell and fire into the hart &amp; euery corner of his houſe, for to burne his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, his wife, children and ſeruaunts, his goods, his houſe, and himſelfe. Compare your actions, with that Bedlem bodies, &amp; ye ſhall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to agree iump: ye bring &amp; lay your goodes, your peines and trauail, your life and honour, at the Lorraines feete, to ayd them to burne this Realme, wherein are your wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruaunts, your kinſ-folke and frends, your goods and your ſelues. Beleeue me, the hopes they feede you with, are vayne. After that by your meane they ſhall become maiſters and Lords of France, they will feare none but you; French-men
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2735:82"/>ſhalbe their onely enemies, and principally the Nobles: they will thinke themſelues neuer aſſured in their vſurpation, vntill they haue quite ouerthrowen and deſtroyed you. Thus, there is no good to be hoped for by the trauail ye take, and hurlibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes ye make; but on the contrary ſide account muſt be made, that from them will iſſue the ruine of this ſtate and your ſelues. Behold, how for a meſſe of Lentil pottage, like a ſort of Eſaus, for a ſinall portion of that which is your owne, which belongeth rather to you, then them that giue it; ye ſell your birth-right, your naturall freedome, the honour of your aunceſtours and your ſelues, your libertie, your repoſe, your goods and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and which paſſeth all, ye band your ſelues againſt God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the courſe of kinde, againſt the lawes; ſo, that ſhame, loſſe, confuſion, and eternall damnation muſt needes awayt you. Abandon therefore this accurſed League, and reenter into the franchiſe and Gentleman-like courage of the French your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours: and like nothing more then the ayre and French name, then the enterteinement of your naturall Princes. Turne your eyes towardes them; and ye ſhall finde in them whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a frank minded Nobilitie may deſire. If ye will liue in quiet, with honour, reknowledgement, &amp; recompence at the hands of one Prince: go to them, ye ſhal finde them agreable, courteous, affable, honorable, magnificent and bountifull; furniſhed and giuen to all exerciſes of true nobleneſſe; and ſuch as can well iudge, remember, and gratifie the merite of Gentlemen. And if a more ſtout courage pricks you on to deſire the recouerie of that, which hath bene vſurped by your neighbours on your liuelihood and honour: who can better aſſiſt and conduct you in ſuch enterpriſes, then your Princes, who haue the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the like that you haue, and the ſame deſire too perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture; who are incomparable in all perfections required in Generals of an army? It is againſt ſtraungers, againſt th'ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of your Princes, that ye muſt arme and conſpire together; which would vndermine, plucke downe and overthrow this Crowne: it is your part to vphold it, it belongeth to your ſtate and charge, it is that which your fathers and you haue ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely and ſo often ſworne. Apply your ſelues and obey to the will of God, to the order of nature, to the conſtitutions of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2735:82"/>the law: conſidering all theſe do fauour you, and preſent to you the moſt accompliſhed Princes that ye may deſire. Range your felues on their ſide. Onely, arme not your ſelues, but abide quietly in your houſes, and the warre ſhall end anone by a good peace, or ſome other meane: God and men will can you thank, &amp; your king chiefly, who will hold his libertie of you: ye know it well ynough; ye may no longer diſſemble.</p>
               <p>And ye, my Iuſticers and Counſellers of Eſtate,
<note place="margin">To Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> why ſwarue ye from the duetie of your charge? why ſet yee at nought the othe ye made to God, to Iuſtice, to the Crowne, and to the King? why hyde ye the talent, that God gaue you? why deſtroy ye god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, mercy, Iuſtice, and law the foundations and aſſurance of the Crowne? why ſhut ye your mouth in the kings preſence? why diſſemble ye with him, that which importeth his reſt, his honour; the preſernation of his Crowne, of his Eſtate, of his Realme, of publike peace; the comfort of his poore ſubiects, and your owne preſeruation? ye reſemble the figge tree ſpoken of in the Goſpell, ye beare a greene leafe, but ye beare no fruict: it was ourſed of the Lord; feare ye the like curſe. Ye be officers of Iuſtice, and yet do concele that which is Iuſtice. ye are Counſellers to the king and yet ye counſell him not: ye are in deede but Counſellers for your ſelues, for that which ſeemeth gainefull to your ſelues, and for ſtraungers againſt him. If his Maieſtie commaunde any thing, that is preiudiciall euer ſo little to you and the companies linked with you, ye ſay that ſuch commaundements are extorted from him againſt his will or witting; ye can then vſe very free admonitions, and declare to him what is Iuſtice; ye be free, hardy, and mightie enough to oppoſe your ſelues againſt ſuch commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. But if his life, repofe, and honor, with the ruine or preſeruation of the weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike ſtande vpon it, although ye ſee that he is forced, that for feare (a word that may make all Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bluſh) euen for feare he is faine to allow that for good, which hee deteſteth in his foule; ye dare not ſpeake, ye mainteine him in his feare, in his captiuitie; your ſelues captiue him (for if he were wel aſſured to finde in you that which ought to be, he would take another courſe to quench this ciuill flame) your ſelues, I ſay, firſt made bond-men through falſe feares, vamechopes, poiſoned and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2735:83"/>gifts. This is the price for which yee ſell your goods, wiues, children, your honor and conſcience, the publike honor &amp; liberty, your countrie &amp; your king. Ye geue your ſclues ouer, ſo to be wonne and poſſeſſed by ſtrangers, that ye haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule in your iudgements and counſels, ſaue their will. If your king make any motion to take aduiſe of you; ye firſt looke them in the face, before ye will ſpeake, ye firſt take direction of them, what anſwere to make. Conſider the pouerties, deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, confuſions &amp; corruptions, which this League whom ye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour hath brought aſwell in your eſtate, as all other eſtates of this Realme. Acknowledge that the League, with the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, propoſitions, practiſes and purſuites, the pretence, the true purpoſe and effects thereof, are moſt miſchieuous &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that the feares and hopes thereof are falſe and vaine. Shake of then your bondages, viſours and diſſimulations: take againe to you the libertie &amp; freedome that iuſtice and God haue gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For of God and of iuſtice ye hold your honours in chiefe, and not of men: ye diſhonour it as much as in you lieth, with daſtardly cowardiſe; ye are in Weales-publike and Monarchies, that which reaſon is in man: if reaſon hath loſt her libertie, if ſhe be enchained, man doth nothing but builde and haſten on his owne loſſe and ignominie. Seeing then ye are fountaines, from whom the reaſon is drawen, wherewith this realme is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned; keepe your ſoules cleere and free, vnder the commaund of reaſon and iuſtice onely; which is true libertie in deede, and according to the ſame conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the League, &amp; all the Leagued. And ſince that happy wiſdome, which foreſeeth &amp; preuenteth perils, could not obteine it at your hands, let vnfortunate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit obteine it. For ye begin to ſee, to feele, and to be oppreſſed with the miſerable effects of the League, and of your winking thereat. Condemne it then freely; euen as it is contrary to the commaundements of God, to the lawes of nature and nations, to the lawes, cuſtomes and vſages of this land: the intent of it is to ouerthrow and confound all: a Countrey waſted (ſay they of the League) is better then a Countrey loſt; thinking that loſt, which they cannot catch. I do not ſay; decree and commaund that armies be ſent againſt it: but onely I ſay condemne it, and ſo leaue it: be reſolued on peace; geue this counſell to our king;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2735:83"/>and leaue to God, to the order of nature and to the law, th'euent of the ſucceſſion of the crown: colour the League no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger with your diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; it will then remaine ſo naked, filthie &amp; ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that none will make account of it, each one will reiect it: and ſo ſhall we all liue in peace, and ſo ſhall ye perceiue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of all eſtates in their former beautie and brightnes, with the reſtoring of your greatnes, authoritie and credite in this Realme: the king &amp; all true Frenchmen will acknowledge themſelues to holde their libertie, name and ſafetie from God &amp; you. And keepe your ſelues within the limites of ciuile iuſtice. Aſſay not to confound your power with Gods; to encroch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rights belonging to the Lord: or els he will diſcouer your ſhame, he will take from you, grace, iudgement, fauour and meanes: he will take from you all. Learne not to exceede the bounds of your auctority, of the Romaine Iudge, who is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Acts: the Iewes brought before him S. Paul, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 18.</note> this felow perſwadeth men to worſhip God otherwiſe than the law appointeth: and as S. Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio (for ſo was the Romane Iudge called) ſaid to the Iewes, if it were a matter of wrong, or an euil deed, I would, according to reaſon, mainteine you: but if it be a queſtion of words and names, and of your law, looke ye to it your ſelues: for I wil be no Iudge of thoſe things, &amp; he draue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgement ſeat. I cite not this example of Gallio, as though ye ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to know the truth in religion, as he was; but that ye ſhould proceed with indifferencie betweene both parties, in caſes not throughly knowen to you as he did. And whereas he refuſed to heare, that which belonged not to him to iudge, although the partie accuſed was preſent, much leſſe ought ye to condemne that cauſe, which ye may not define, or thoſe perſons whom ye neuer heard ſpeake in their owne defenſe. Likewiſe, as he draue thoſe importunate accuſers from the iudgement ſeat, ſo ought ye to driue theſe imperious. Leaguers from your ſeats of Iuſtice, from your tables of counſell, when they go about to driue you to treſpaſſe the bounds of your dutie, and inuade the king dome of the word, which in all cauſes of Religion ſhould iudge now, as it ſhall iudge at the latter day. Leaue then to the word of God alone that which pertayneth to the iuriſdiction thereof,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2735:84"/>and muſt be reſerued thereto, according to Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if ye proceede to take knowledge of religion, let the word of God onely be the rule and ſquire of your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. On th'other ſide account them not condemned, nor he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes conuict, nor iuſtly deliuered to your ſecular arme, who are not condemned but by their aduerſaries, by their ſworne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies againſt the order and manner of iudgements. Fauour no more, with hazard to be ioinct perſecutors, them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Church and this Realme, for no cauſe but their appetites, reuenges, and ambition, and not for weeding of the Church, as they pretend, and yet that is not permitted them. Vſe no more the ſeruice of butcherly executioners, of principall maſſacrers, robbers and riflers, for th'execution of the wrongs and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the League, of th'excommunications and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Clergy pronounced vpon no cauſe but fury; and ye ſhall finde the bleſſing of God, the fauour of your king; the wiſhes, applauſes, and praiſes of the people ſhall aſſiſt you in ſo doing, rather then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And ye (my poore People) murmur no more,
<note place="margin">To the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> mutter nor mutine no more within your Cities, Boroughs, and Villages, to fauour with your outcries, your wiſhes, your trauail, your armes and your life, this damnable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie of the Leagued. Ye feele to the quicke, how vaine and deceiueable their propoſitions are. They promiſed you diſcharge, comfort, liberty, abundance, caſe, and quiet. They ſaid, they would deale betweene the king and you, to obteyne of his Maieſtie the reformation of all things to your contentment, and chiefly to the aboliſhment or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of taxes. And now ſee, how their armies haue ſpoyled you of al your goods, haue depriued you of the fruit of your labours, haue gnawen you to the very boanes, haue taken the bread and water out of your hands. They haue, and yet do conſtraine your king to encreaſe the taxes, to draw bloud from you till the laſt drop, to vrge you with all rigors, wherewith he is extremely ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeued. Furthermore, ye know and feele by the peſtilence and famine, which outragiouſly range among you, that God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſuch conſpiracies. Beleeue me, no other thing can come to you of the League, except a moſt great and vnrecouerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. For this is ordinary, that diuiſions among great men,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2735:84"/>whatſoeuer pretence they make, work no other effect then waſt of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, turmoyle, loſſe &amp; ruine of the people: the people alwaies play the principal part in the tragedies of Ciuil warres, they ſerue in ſteed of the Chorus or Quier to bewaile their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune without ceaſing: great men conſume them as fewell to maintaine the fire of their diuiſion, the fire of their ambition. Behold th'ordinary fruit and ſucceſſe of enterpriſes, which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vndertake or fauour againſt God, his word, and Iuſtice. So long as the League ſhall endure, matters ſhall go from bad to worſe. ye haue the pay and wages, whereof ye are but too ſure. For beſides the retyring, eſtranging and diſpaire to atchieue thoſe hopes which the League fed you with all, ye haue, as I told you, plague and famine, ſurplus of taxes, torment, waſt, violences and riots of men of warre. Geue it ouer then, lend it no longer your eares, your wills or fauours. Returne ech of you to your houſes, to the exerciſe of your callings: keepe your thoughts, your deſires and labours within the clofure of your fields and ſhops. Craue for peace of God and the king. Craue it of God with earneſt prayers, &amp; with ſubmiſſion &amp; obedience a good ſucceſſour of your king. And go not on ſtill to draw de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction wholy on your heads, vpon a falſe feare of that thing which can not come on you in any wiſe, and when it ſhall come it can not bring with it ſo great harme to you in your whole liues, as one yeare alone of warre bringeth. Ye ſhall no ſooner haue forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the League, but peace ſhalbe at your walles, it ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be publiſhed &amp; mainteined in your towne &amp; Cities. ye ſhal no ſooner haue forſaken it, but that proſperitie and other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God ſhall lodge in your towne, houſes and families; ſhall appeare in your perſons, and on the labour of your hands, ſhall fatten your fieldes and multiply your fruicts: warre, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and famine ſhall vaniſh away: peace, and Gods grace ſhall ſhine againe on you.</p>
               <p>And you (my King) lift vp your ſelfe about the diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Counſellers,
<note place="margin">To the King</note> who for the moſt part (to the miſhap of you and of all this State) are wonne already by ſtraungers, or parties ſworne too farre in the differences of Religion; they are auctours or part-takers in all theſe tumultes. Sir diſcerne them: ſeeke not for truth or faithfulneſſe, where paſſion rules: take
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2735:85"/>counſell aboue all of God and your ſoule. Heare th'one and th'other before ye ordeine, and cauſe your Edicts to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and executed. They, againſt whom theſe men prouoke you, make no profeſſion but of the Goſpell, of the word of God: enquire whether they falſely attribute to themſelues this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or no: itſtands you greatly vpon to do ſo. For if the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reformed is true, doubtleſſe ye band your ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, againſt the kingdome of his word, againſt the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Goſpell, againſt the Reformation of his Church: ye au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriſe men againſt God; you preferre your commaundements before his, you enter your name among the perſecutours of the Church. And thereupon you caſt your ſelfe headlong into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the curſes of God: you geue your ſelfe ouer to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. plagues and torments which the hiſtories and word of God teach vs to be prouided aſwel in this world as in the world to come, for perſecutors of the Church. You know, how God ſent moſt dreadful plagues on Antiochus, Herod and many mo for their entrepriſes preſumed and done againſt him and his Church. The ſame God, that reigned then, reigneth yet ſtill, and is as much to be feared as euer he was, and alſo mighty to do miracles, as then he was. He reproueth euen kings for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.</note> faith Dauid: he reproueth them with plagues as he did Pharao and the king of Gerar that vexed his choſen. Let God then reigne ouer you,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.20.</note> leaue to him and his word the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of mens conſciences; let it ſuffice you that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo. Man cau not iudge nor force the conſcience. for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proueth it to be impoſſible. Your anceſtors being kings haue left you examples of this obedience. They permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Princes, and other ſubiects, to tell them freely that God was to be obeyed rather then they. This appeareth in the requeſtes preſented to Charles the ſixth by the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goine &amp; of Lembourg, &amp; by the Earle of Neuers; were allowed by the king and his Counſel. We reade alſo that the Duke of Britaine being required to acknowledge Pope Clement, by one of your predeceſſours, ſaid to him in preſence of his Princes and all his Counſell; that for his dignitie of being Duke of Britaine he was bound to do fealtie and homage to his Maieſty, but in behalfe of Religion &amp; his conſcience, he ought no dutie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2735:85"/>but to God alone: his aunſwere was found reaſonable; there was no more ſpoken to him: no army was ſent into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to compell him to beleeue in Pope Clement. And in deed, in force and violence is no religion, as hath amply bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed: it is but a moſt damnable pretence. Returne then quickly out of this euill way that leadeth to perdition. Iudge not the controuerſies of religion, but with and after the word, all things being faithfully, lawfully and ſurely handled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. Let not man, couetouſnes, enure and ambition ouer-rule any more in ſuch affaires. Let not th'abominable prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the League arme you any more againſt your humbleſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſubiects, againſt the Princes of your bloud, to the loſſe of your ſaluation &amp; honor, &amp; to the ſubuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this realme. Haue ſome pitie (Sir) of your ſoule: for God is highly diſpleaſed at ſuch purſuits ful of miuſtice and impietie. Haue pitie of your honor and of the honor of your Counſellers, of your Lieutenants and Magiſtrates that dependeth on yours. Take heed, that it be not ſpoken of you, now and ſo long as the world ſhall endure, that you are and haue bene one of the perſecutors of Gods Church! what diſhonour ſhall it bring to you and your memory when Hiſtorians ſhall recken you in the ſame Role with Herod. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, Caracalla, Maximus, Diocleſian, and other perſecutors of the Goſpel? Take heed alſo, leaſt it be ſaid of you, that you haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the lawes of France; that you defacefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the name of Frenchmen; that you haue ouerthrowne and trampled vnder feet the libertie and honour of this Realme, that you haue brought it to vtter ruine; that ye haue giuen it in pray, firſt to ciuile warres, after to the tyranny of ſtrangers. Sir, take compaſſion and pitie on your poore people; they can do no more: Ieaue of to torment them, and your ſelfe alſo, at the pleaſure of ſtraungers enemies of your quiet and your peoples. What iniury haue your Princes and your couſins done you, that you are ſo moued againſt them, ſauing that they ſtepped backe like faithfull vaſſals, when you would haue ſmitten them at the inſtigation of ſtrangers? they haue in as modeſt maner as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defenſe would permit them put of the blowes of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies guided and ſet on by ſtraungers their enimies, and (to ſay the truth) yours alſo, though they were infinitely vexed in their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2735:86"/>perſons, poſſeſſions and goods vnder the auctoritie or rather abuſe of your name: they haue left of armes foorthwith euen when you commaunded them: they haue gone towards you &amp; retired from you euen when it pleaſed your Maieſtie. Behold the onely occaſions that you haue to wiſh them euill. And yet you are told that they diſturbe your quiet, and your Realmes. Let deeds and not wordes witneſſe the truth therein. Iudge you who be th'auctors of the ciuill warres: whether they, that after ſundry excuſes, by force and conſtrainct take armes, only for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of their perſons, goods, and liberty of their conſciences; or cls they that take armes for to breake and diſanull your Edicts, your faith and the faith publike giuen by othe, to giue onſet to your Crowne, vpon the Princes of your bloud, to come nigh to it by their recoylings, to mount vp to it by their abbaſings, to get into their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the rights of your Princes, to fatte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the bloud of your people: that know they haue no other way to grow great, nor meane to maintayne their new encreaſes of greatnes, to diue into your treaſures and reuenues, then by warre, and during warre. Conſider alſo, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom you purſue, are moſt worthy to be auowed of you for kinſime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be named your ſucceſſors, vntill it ſhal pleaſe God to giue you a ſonne to be your ſucceſſour. Looke on th'other ſide how the Leagued diſpoile your ſelfe of the greateſt part of your rights, and of the honour belonging to your, ſo that (as ſeemeth) they lacke nothing but your name; how they haue ſhared with you in your kingdome, vſurping all the power and honour, &amp; leauing you the bare title: they preſume within your townes and ouer your Nobility with more ſoueraignety then your ſelf; they cauſe moſt preachers throughout Fraunce, and perſons ſuborned in all aſſemblies and meetings to publiſh their valor, their affection, their victories, which in deede are yours and none of theirs. Reenter then, Sir, into the true poſſeſſion, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and limits of your power. It is the honour of a Prince to let limite his ſoueraigne power by the worde of God, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whatſoeuer the flatterers of the Court, the corrupters of Kings and Princes, chat to the contrary. But, commaund you that, which God and reaſon commaundeth you. Feare God, &amp; let men feare you. Beleeue them not, nor feare them any more,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2735:86"/>that ſet before your eyes the great intelligences and powers of the League: you know now the weakneſſe of the Leagued, the vanitie of their promiſes, hopes and threatnings by their actes and executions: their intelligences and forces are aſſured in none, but in you. Th'Italian is too much diuided; the Spaniard hath too much to do, for to enterpriſe againſt you: moſt of your Frenchmen fauour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, but for their reſpect to your Name, which th'Edicts beare in their fore-head: reuoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; returne to th'obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your oths. Doubt not of your ſubiects obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; ſpeake your wil frankly, &amp; ſee who dare diſobey? what if ſome ſtorme &amp; ſtir, whom feare, fury, &amp; diſpaire of pardon driue on, who being vnworthy wil be as vnwilling to make trial of your grace? let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> run on like mad beaſts till they haue gored them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The body of your ſtate will be the better, when a meany of ſuch biles are launced. Onely, geue peace to your ſelfe &amp; your people: make account that none ſhal be able to hinder ſo holy a purpoſe, &amp; in ſo doing you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not do amiſſe. Peace ſhall further your zele towards the Church, &amp; your affection towards your Subiects. For in one yeere of peace, th'exerciſe of religion wel &amp; duly performed on th'one ſide and th'other, ſhall bring againe more ſoules to the right way, then all the forces in the world may, that rather waſt then weed the Lords field, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then conuert conſciences. The word of God demaundeth not warlike armes, but willing eares to heare it, to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Chriſtians of the primitiue Church did not by armes hinder the ſacrificing and preaching in honour of Idols; but onely required that themſelues might be permitted to ſpeake alſo. And certeinly, no man can oppoſe himſelfe more directly againſt the kingdome of God, or more openly deſtroy &amp; confound conſciences, then if he trouble the Church of God with armes. For during war, vice reigneth, Gods word hath no ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, is not heard, is not receiued, is not kept. And ſo, you can not in better ſort ſhew your affection towards your people, then in geuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a good &amp; laſting peace: for without it, all the directions &amp; ordinances which you may make, can not ſtand. It is impoſſible to ſtay the abuſes, enterpriſes &amp; violences of Gouernors; to reſtore the Church &amp; Iuſtice; to order the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; to pacifie the Cities; to relieue the people; and bring them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2735:87"/>to their duetie againe, during the warre. It is impoſſible for a king to be a good king, or for a ſubiect to be a good ſubiect, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ciuill warre. To be ſhort, the Scripture teacheth vs, that peace and reſt are the foundation and aſſurance of the Church, of Iuſtice, of kings, and of ſubiects. I will ſay further, by your good leaue, that ciuil warres take away with them alwaies ſome part of the Princes honor. Call to remembrance the ſaying of the Emperour Martian; to wit, that it is not honeſt nor honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a Prince to take armes; ſo long as he may liue in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable peace. Enioy therefore your Realme peaceably. Toile not your ſelfe for that thing which ſtandes you in no ſteade, which tendeth not but to make you burie your France with your conſcience and honour. Leaue to God the ſucceſſe of your ſucceſſion; it belongeth to him: chiefly ſeeing that without dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and confuſion of the Church, and without ruining your ſubiects and your Realme, you can not perfourme that which the Leagued doo propound you. Sir, pull downe your owne will, and the counſels of men, to ſet vp the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God; &amp; God ſhal pull downe the wil of your enemies, to ſet vp your will.</p>
               <p>Finally (my children) ye ſee how God condemneth your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fighteth againſt them by all kinde of calamities, with peſtilences &amp; other deaſe, blinde &amp; ſtrange diſeaſes, vnknowen to your Phyſicians: by warres, fammes, and ghaſtly feares, which ſtoupe nor yeeld at all to your wiſdome and trauaile: God condemneth your conſpiracies by the wretchednes &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their effects, by the conſpiracy of the ayre and ſeaſons, which bande themſelues againſt you, which marre themſelues to marre you, which arme themſelues to execute on you the iuſtice of Gods curſes and vengeance. If you harden your harts againſt this ſpeach which your ſoueraigne God vſeth, if ye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not; he will ſpeake to you yet more aloude, more plainly more roughly. Be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted then. Go (my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) craue mercie of the Lord, crie ſtill to him till he repaire and ſet his Church for his praiſe in the land: yelde your ſelues guilty, and ſeeke his face, till he come &amp; make his mercy &amp; rightcouſnes to raine on you, till he be the plague of the plague, the deſtruction of the graue, the dearth of famine, and the ſword of the ſword.</p>
